Close living arrangements with animals and poultry, poverty, lack of regulations, poor infection control hygiene practices and inadequate resources, exacerbates the risk of emerging infections, making the country a hotspot for the emergence of a number of infectious diseases, including those with epidemic or pandemic potential. Our research focuses on detection and response, building on our existing partnerships and surveillance capabilities and aims to provide important data for prioritizing emerging infections for public health intervention in Bangladesh. The proposed projects address important public health problems of Bangladesh, which will provide clinicians and policy makers with data to make public health decisions. Our surveillances support International Health Regulations (IHR), Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), global health security and global surveillances.

One readily obtainable toxic chemical that is considered of particular risk is parathion, a highly toxic (LD50 ~2 mg/kg) organophosphate insecticide. Parathion is a restricted, but widely used agricultural chemical that becomes a toxic nerve agent once absorbed into the body where it is metabolized to a reactive metabolite called paraoxon. A major site of action for paraoxon is the enzyme acetylcholinesterase; proper functioning of this enzyme is crucial for normal nerve cell activity and its inhibition can be fatal. There are several treatments for organophosphate poisoning including atropine, a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine, and pralidoxime which binds to organophosphate-inactivated acetylcholinesterase and regenerates the enzyme. Both of these agents have limitations and there remains a pressing need to develop new more efficacious therapies for parathion poisoning. Success of this proposal will lead to the rapid development of a new agent to treat human exposure to a high priority chemical threat.","6717688 (contact); 7536679; ","LASKIN, JEFFREY D (contact); RICHARDSON, JASON R;","JETT, DAVID ALAN","09/30/2018","09/29/2023","Accidents; Acetylcholine; Acetylcholinesterase; Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors; Acute; Advanced Development; Adverse event; Aftercare; Agrochemicals; Antidotes; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Atropine; base; Binding; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Coagulation Disorders; carboxylesterase; chemical threat; Chemistry; Cholinergic Antagonists; Clinical Trials; Cytochrome P450; Data; Development; Disease; Dose; drug development; Drug usage; Effectiveness; efficacious treatment; Electron Transport; Emergency Situation; enzyme activity; Enzymes; experimental study; exposed human population; Exposure to; FDA approved; Generations; Goals; Human; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; inorganic phosphate; Insecticides; Intoxication; Isoenzymes; Laboratories; Lead; Lethal Dose 50; Malignant Neoplasms; mass casualty; Mediating; Metabolic Activation; Metabolism; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor; Muscarinic Antagonists; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Natural Disasters; Natural regeneration; nerve agent; Neurons; neurotoxicity; New Agents; novel; novel strategies; Occupational Exposure; Oral Administration; organophosphate poisoning; Organophosphates; Oxidation-Reduction; Oximes; Paraoxon; Parathion; Pesticides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; Phase; Phase I/II Clinical Trial; Poison; Poisoning; pre-clinical; preclinical study; prevent; programs; Publications; Rattus; Recording of previous events; Research; Risk; safety assessment; Serum; Site; standard of care; success; Symptoms; System; Terrorism; Therapeutic; therapeutic candidate; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; toxicant; Toxicology; Translations; Vitamin K 3; ","Advanced Development of Drugs to Mitigate Parathion Intoxication","108956","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","603206","156010","759216",""

Although the intent of SNF care is to allow recuperation and rehabilitation, Veterans who do not successfully recover are commonly placed in institutional long-term care at significant cost to themselves and to the VA, which spends more than $7 billion annually on institutional care. Veterans receive care in SNFs inside and outside the VA with different rates of success in returning them to the community. This project seeks to identify ?high-value? SNFs (those that deliver the best rates of returning Veterans to the community for the lowest costs) across VA and non-VA facilities and understand how much ?matching? a Veteran with specific needs to specific SNFs improves value.

To directly address these questions, we will perform Patch-Seq electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphometric analyses of L3 pyramidal cells recorded in acute slices of LPFC, ACC and V1 from behaviorally characterized young and aged monkeys.

Uganda is located in a hot spot for these infections, many of which may be zoonotic. We propose to leverage the research and capacity building experience of the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) and its collaborative and productive relationship with the government of Uganda to study the infectious causes of acute febrile illness in both adults and children. We will use existing tools to increase the proportion of acute febrile hospitalized patients for whom we have a specific diagnosis, to implement sero-surveillance to understand exposure to various infectious diseases including vaccine preventable illness, priority pathogens, and vector-borne infections, and to study inflammatory biomarkers in children and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. The IDI is a research, clinical and training center of excellence. Established in 2002, the IDI has established a strong track record in performing locally relevant research that leads to improved models of care and changes in policy and practice in the area of HIV and related infections. In addition, the outreach programs largely funded by the CDC and PEPFAR as the key implementing partner took a strong health systems institutional strengthening approach to provide prevention care and treatment to more than 100,000 patients. The proposal addresses the critical barriers to achieving global health security in Uganda by collating and analyzing existing data from cohorts and diagnostic testing, and enhancing surveillance through lab capacity strengthening and technical transfer of innovative new laboratory techniques to maximize our ability to make a diagnosis. It is innovative because it leverages previous US government/PEPFAR investments in the IDI from HIV programs and uses the IDI?s expertise in research, training, clinical care, implementation, and scale-up for global health security. In addition, it leverages the close working relationship between the current and former Senior Management Team members at the IDI to recruit acutely febrile cohorts to test and implement rapid diagnostic innovation. Establishing diagnostic certainty in a larger proportion of febrile patients will allow for targeted antimicrobial treatment (reducing risk for antimicrobial resistance). It will also increase the signal sensitivity to detect new pathogens with epidemic potential. The research productivity, programmatic track record, and existing collaborative partnerships of the IDI increase the likelihood of success.

The evaluation study will be a collaboration led by NCDC which includes Georgetown University and AFENET to be implemented by an assembled multi-disciplinary team with proven records of research success and experience with disease surveillance program implementation; community-based participatory research, sustainability evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. It is anticipated that the utility of data from this evaluation would inform decisions to strengthen the (IDSR) framework nationally. This is critical in promoting the best use of data collection resources to support the achievement of VHF surveillance targets and address the root cause of performance gaps in the VHF surveillance system. The Surgical Site Infection Surveillance Study This proposed Surgical Site Infection (SSI) surveillance study will proffer comprehensive Hospital Acquired Surgical Site Infection (SSI) epidemiologic data that will contribute to informing the development of effective IPC interventions and promoting patient safety in Nigeria.

It appears to be present in a large percentage of professional players of contact sports and has been found in many studies of military veterans. Symptoms may include memory and emotional problems, suicidality and dementia. The disease typically progresses over a period of years or decades, and there is currently no known treatment that can slow or cure this process. Our laboratory has developed a novel immune regulatory drug (JM4) that shows remarkable beneficial effects in multiple models of neurodegeneration. We will test the hypothesis that JM4 will downregulate chronic inflammatory responses and block or reverse the development of rmTBI. We have recently received FDA approval for use of JM4 as an investigational new drug, and successful findings in this study may lead rapidly towards development of the first treatment for this devastating disease.

Here, we will leverage powerful live imaging and analysis methods developed by my lab to address fundamental questions about cell extrusion and stem cell behaviors during intestinal shrinkage; the knowledge we generate will create a conceptual framework that will inform vertebrate and possibly human studies of the intestine in both health and disease.","6912732; ","O'BRIEN, LUCY ERIN;","GREENWEL, PATRICIA","09/30/2021","08/31/2025","Address; Adopted; Adult; Anatomy; Animals; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; base; Behavior; Biology; body cavity; Calcium Oscillations; Celiac Disease; cell behavior; Cell Count; Cell division; Cell Lineage; Cell Therapy; Cells; Complex; Data; Daughter; Digestive Physiology; Disease; Drosophila genus; Endotoxemia; Enterocytes; Equation; Equilibrium; Experimental Models; Famines; fly; Food; frontier; Future; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Giardiasis; Goals; Growth; Health; Human; human disease; Image; in vivo; in vivo monitoring; Individual; Ingestion; innovation; Intestines; Invertebrates; Investigation; Knowledge; Label; Laboratories; Laboratory Study; Mammals; Mammary gland; mature animal; mechanical force; Mechanics; Methods; Midgut; Mitosis; Modeling; Modernization; Molecular; Monitor; Nutrient; optogenetics; Organ; Organ Size; Parenteral Nutrition; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Periodicity; Physiological; promoter; Protocols documentation; purge; Refractory; Regulation; Reporter; Research; response; Rodent; serial imaging; Siblings; Side; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Skin; Small Intestines; Starvation; stem cell differentiation; stem cell division; stem cells; Testing; Time; Tissues; tool; Transcription Coactivator; Translating; Undifferentiated; virtual; Wild Animals; Withdrawal; Work; ","Mechanisms of Physiological Organ Shrinkage","128485","DEV1","Development - 1 Study Section ","","A1","01","304252","174640","478892",""

One problem is that medical records usually do not contain information about social risk factors.

We use Alzheimer patient derived cells and a new mouse model to test the overall hypothesis that U94A, which is expressed during latent HHV6A infection, is a disease-modifying factor that impairs the normal function of neurons and glial cells, and may increase patient vulnerability to other AD causing factors thereby accelerating AD onset and pathology.","6618129; ","MAYER-PROSCHEL, MARGOT ;","MACKIEWICZ, MIROSLAW","09/30/2021","05/31/2026","abeta accumulation; Address; Affect; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease pathology; Alzheimer's disease patient; Alzheimer's disease risk; Amyloid beta-42; Amyloid beta-Protein; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animal Model; APP-PS1; Axon; base; Behavioral Assay; benign state; Brain; Cell Culture System; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular pathology; cellular transduction; Cognitive deficits; cognitive development; cohort; Data; Defect; Demyelinations; Dendritic Spines; Diffuse; Disease; Disease Progression; Environmental Risk Factor; epidemiology study; experimental study; familial Alzheimer disease; Gelsolin; Genes; Genetic; Goals; HHV-6A; Human; Human Herpesvirus 6; hyperphosphorylated tau; Impaired cognition; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons; Infection; Infectious Agent; Inflammation; insight; Knock-in Mouse; Learning; Length; Light; Link; Memory; Microscopy; Microtubules; migration; Morphology; mouse model; multiple omics; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Neuraxis; Neurites; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neuroglia; Neurons; neurotropic virus; oligodendrocyte progenitor; Oligodendroglia; Onset of illness; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; performance tests; Phenotype; Play; Process; Proteins; Proteomics; Publishing; Regulation; remyelination; Resolution; Risk Factors; Role; Severities; sex; stem cells; Swedish mutation; Synapses; System; tau phosphorylation; Testing; tool; transcriptomics; Transgenic Mice; Variant; vector control; Virus Diseases; Virus Latency; Work; ","Impact of the Human Herpesvirus 6A (HHV6A) latency gene U94A on Alzheimer disease pathology","075978","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","519443","192170","711613",""

Drug eluting stents reduce the risk of restenosis compared to bare metal stents but require longer dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a thienopyridine inhibitor to prevent stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, but with higher risks of major bleeding. Currently, newer 2nd-generation drug eluting stents have replaced the 1st-generation stents, and more potent DAPT agents offer lower risks of myocardial infarction. Shorter duration DAPT could lower the risk of complications from major bleeding and treatment costs. However, there are no large trials to assess the benefits or risks of shorter DAPT. Veterans receiving PCI in the VA have 2-4 times the risk of death or myocardial infarction compared to patients in largely non-VA research studies. Thus the question of DAPT duration remains critically important in the VA.","9068277; ","KINLAY, SCOTT ;","","07/01/2017","06/30/2022","administrative database; Antiplatelet Drugs; Applications Grants; Aspirin; Atherosclerosis; base; Cardiac; Cardiac Catheterization Procedures; Cardiovascular system; Catheterization; cerebrovascular; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clopidogrel; cohort; Conflict (Psychology); Coronary; Coronary Artery Bypass; Data; Databases; Drug usage; Early Intervention; Event; Funding; Generations; Grant; Guidelines; Health; Health system; Hemorrhage; high risk; high risk population; Hospitals; indexing; inhibitor/antagonist; Laboratories; Medicare; Metals; mortality; mortality risk; Myocardial Infarction; New Agents; Observational Study; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patients; percutaneous coronary intervention; Pharmaceutical Preparations; prevent; Randomized Controlled Trials; Records; Recurrence; Regimen; Reporting; research study; restenosis; Risk; Risk Factors; Sample Size; secondary endpoint; stent thrombosis; Stents; Stroke; therapy duration; thienopyridine; Time; Treatment Cost; treatment duration; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans; Veterans Health Administration; ","Rationalizing Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Coronary Stenting","001549","EPID","Epidemiology ","","","05","","","",""

This condition results in progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, which lead to dramatic repercussions for affected individuals and their families. Many genetic studies have identified sex differences to be a critical factor in AD risk, progression, and severity across individuals, but precisely which sex-related mechanisms are responsible for these differences remain unknown. These studies systematically dissect the mechanisms underlying these observed differences using cutting-edge experimental and computational methods to predict sex-specific causal variants, regulatory regions, genes, and pathways; and systematic experimental characterization of predicted drivers using mouse models to better understand the mechanistic basis of sex-related differences in AD. These results will form the foundation for a deeper understanding of AD and new therapeutic development against this devastating disorder.","8615999 (contact); 1865384; ","KELLIS, MANOLIS  (contact); TSAI, LI-HUEI ;","YUAN, JEAN","09/30/2021","05/31/2026","Address; Affect; Age; age related; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease patient; Alzheimer's disease risk; Amyloid; Autopsy; base; Biological Assay; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; brain cell; Brain region; Categories; causal variant; cell type; Cells; Cerebrovascular system; cohort; Computing Methodologies; Data; Data Set; Dementia; Development; Disease; Dissection; DNA; Electronic Health Record; Enhancers; epigenomics; Family; Female; Foundations; frontal lobe; Functional disorder; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Risk; genetic signature; Genetic study; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Genotype; Germ Cells; Healthcare; Heterogeneity; Hi-C; Hippocampus (Brain); Homeostasis; Hormonal; Human; Image; Impaired cognition; in vitro Model; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Intervention; Lead; Libido; Life; Light; Link; Lipids; male; Maps; Memory Loss; Metabolic; mind control; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Molecular Mechanisms of Action; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Neurodegenerative Disorders; novel therapeutics; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; Pathway interactions; Patients; personalized medicine; personalized therapeutic; Phenotype; Physiological; promoter; Regulatory Element; Resolution; Resources; Risk; risk variant; Sampling; Severities; Severity of illness; sex; Sex Differences; single-cell RNA sequencing; Synaptic plasticity; System; Testing; therapeutic development; Transcription Alteration; Untranslated RNA; Validation; Variant; XCL1 gene; ","Single-cell epigenomic and trancriptional dissection of sex-specific differences in Alzheimer?s Disease","074003","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","716072","360844","1076916",""

Several psychotherapies, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT), have been recommended as efficacious for the treatment of PTSD. Yet many individuals show limited benefit from such treatments. There is therefore a urgent need to identify relevant factors that may affect treatment response in PTSD. Accumulating evidence indicates that cognitive deficits adversely affect psychotherapy efficacy in PTSD. However, research is critically needed that examines the pathways by which cognitive functioning affects treatment outcomes to provide an empirical basis for the development of appropriate rehabilitation interventions. The proposed study aims to systematically examine how memory dysfunction affects treatment outcomes during CPT, including memory for treatment, treatment utilization, PTSD symptoms, and functional outcomes, with the goal of guiding development of novel rehabilitation interventions.","10978384; ","SCOTT, JAMES COBB;","","10/01/2018","09/30/2022","Address; Adherence; Affect; Aftercare; Ambulatory Care Facilities; base; Behavioral; Clinical; clinical practice; Cognition; Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; cognitive performance; cognitive testing; Cognitive Therapy; combat veteran; community center; Development; Diagnostic; Disease; efficacious treatment; Emotional; Emotions; Enrollment; Episodic memory; executive function; Exhibits; experience; Foundations; functional outcomes; functional status; Future; General Population; Goals; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Impaired cognition; improved; Individual; innovation; insight; Intervention; Interview; Lead; Measures; Mediating; Medical center; Memory; memory consolidation; Memory impairment; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Neuropsychology; novel; Outcome; Participant; Pathway interactions; Performance; Philadelphia; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Prediction of Response to Therapy; prospective memory; Psychotherapy; Public Health; Questionnaires; reduce symptoms; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; research and development; Role; Societies; symptom treatment; Symptoms; Testing; therapy outcome; Time; Translating; treatment adherence; Treatment Effectiveness; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment outcome; treatment response; Verbal Learning; Veterans; Work; ","Cognitive and Psychotherapy in PTSD: Mechanisms and Functional Outcomes","002699","RRD4","Behavioral Health & Social Reintegration ","","","04","","","",""

Often patients with CLBP do not experience relief from the many treatments they receive when these treatments are spine-centered rather than patient-centered. There are many conditions outside of the spine that can cause CLBP and disability such as hip arthritis, fibromyalgia, and depression, but healthcare providers often do not recognize and treat these conditions as part of treating CLBP. We have developed protocols tailored to the needs of older adults for treating important CLBP and disability-causing conditions. The purpose of the proposed clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of Aging Backs Clinics that treat older Veterans with CLBP using these protocols as compared with usual care.

To better understand the disease mechanism and develop new therapies, we propose to: investigate whether the PARP dependent cell death pathway acts as a common RP mechanism; identify compounds which promote photoreceptor survival in new RP zebrafish model via perform in vivo phenotypic drug screening; and validate identified compounds in established mouse RP models.","12327841; ","ZHANG, LIYUN ;","SHEN, GRACE L","09/30/2021","06/30/2026","Affect; base; Behavior; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Blindness; Categories; Cell Death; Cell Death Process; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinical Trials; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Disease; Disease model; Disease Pathway; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dose; drug candidate; Drug Delivery Systems; drug discovery; Drug Modelings; Drug Screening; Drug Targeting; Etiology; Exhibits; Fishes; Fluorescence; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Models; Goals; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; Human; human disease; improved; in vivo; Inherited; inherited retinal degeneration; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Intervention; Investigation; Kinetics; Knock-out; Label; Larva; Lead; Link; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Neuroprotective Agents; novel; novel therapeutics; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenotype; photoreceptor degeneration; Photoreceptors; Play; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; preservation; Process; Proteins; Publishing; Reader; Research; Resources; response; Retina; Retinal Cone; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Diseases; retinal rods; Retinitis Pigmentosa; rho; Rod; Role; Route; screening; Series; Severities; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Structure of beta Cell of islet; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; Therapeutic Index; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Transgenic Organisms; Translations; Vision; Visual; Whole Organism; Work; Zebrafish; ","Drug Screening for Neuroprotectants in Novel Zebrafish Models of Retinitis Pigmentosa","032533","DDNS","Drug Discovery for the Nervous System Study Section ","","","01","250000","159375","409375",""

Despite the potential of weight loss to reverse OSA, real-world impact is limited. Veterans seldom receive weight loss services due to a lack of counseling and poor accessibility of current weight loss offerings. Furthermore, there is uncertainty around the benefits of modest weight loss in achieving meaningful outcomes in OSA. To overcome access and knowledge gaps, this trial will examine the effectiveness of a population health approach to weight loss care among Veterans with OSA. We will use a remote lifestyle-based weight loss intervention that is self-directed, low- technology, and likely low cost. We propose a pragmatic trial of proactively delivering this novel intervention among patients with newly diagnosed OSA. We will test whether such an intervention improves weight and meaningful outcomes including sleep-related quality of life, sleep symptoms, and cardiovascular risk.","14644056; ","DONOVAN, LUCAS MATTHEW;","","10/01/2021","09/30/2025","Address; Adopted; Adoption; Affect; Apnea; base; behavior change; Blood Pressure; Body Weight decreased; budget impact; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Caring; Characteristics; clinical practice; comorbidity; control trial; cost; Counseling; Data; diabetes prevention program; Diagnosis; Diet; Disease; Disease Management; Effectiveness; effectiveness evaluation; effectiveness outcome; effectiveness testing; efficacy trial; Ensure; Evaluation; Family; follow-up; Future; Geography; Goals; Health; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; high risk population; Hybrids; implementation outcomes; implementation process; Improve Access; improved; indexing; innovation; Internet; Intervention; Knowledge; Life Style; lifestyle intervention; Link; literacy; Lung; Maintenance; Measures; medical specialties; Modeling; Modernization; Nature; neglect; Newly Diagnosed; novel; Obesity; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; Outcome; Outcome Measure; outcome prediction; Paper; Participant; Patients; Personal Satisfaction; Persons; Physiological; Planning Techniques; Policies; Population; population health; pragmatic trial; pressure; Prevention; primary endpoint; primary outcome; programs; Provider; Qualitative Methods; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance; remote intervention; Research; Research Design; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Schedule; secondary outcome; Self-Direction; Service delivery model; Services; Severities; Sleep; Symptoms; System; Technology; telehealth; Telephone; Testing; Time; Time trend; tool; Translating; treatment as usual; Uncertainty; Veterans; virtual healthcare; Visit; Weight; Weight Gain; weight loss intervention; weight loss program; Weight maintenance regimen; Work; ","Pragmatic Obstructive Sleep Apnea Weight Loss Trial Assessing Effectiveness and Reach (POWER)","003319","HSR1","HSR-1   Medical Care and Clinical Management ","","A1","01","","","",""

We are seeking Pilot funding to perform a developmental formative evaluation that will answer our questions. Using a mixed methods study design, first, we will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential usefulness of a decision support tool for use at hospital discharge.

We found that C. elegans can ?read? the identity of bacteria through the bacteria?s own small RNAs, and subsequently use that information to influence behavior, avoiding the pathogen and passing this information on to four generations of progeny ? and it may have co-opted a genomic ?parasite,? a retrotransposon, to do so.

This novel functional imaging technique will be applied to evaluate photoreceptor replacement therapy in the fovea, the area of the retina that mediates high quality vision.

We will partner with VA leadership, clinicians, patients, and caregivers, to prioritize SDHs that are actionable (i.e., addressable through VA or community services) and develop recommendations for SDH measure screening procedures and electronic health record integration.","1911804; 10844188 (contact); ","MACIEJEWSKI, MATTHEW L; ZULMAN, DONNA MICHELLE (contact);","","10/01/2021","09/30/2025","Academy; Accident and Emergency department; Address; Affect; Area; base; Bed Occupancy; Behavioral; Businesses; Caregivers; Caring; Clinical; clinical care; Communities; Community Services; cost; Coupled; COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Data; Disadvantaged; disadvantaged population; economic outcome; Economics; Electronic Health Record; Emergency department visit; Environmental Risk Factor; ethnic minority population; Evaluation; experience; Financial Hardship; food insecurity; Funding; Future; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; health care service utilization; health care settings; health disparity; health equity; health record; Health system; Healthcare; high risk; Hospital Costs; Hospital Departments; Hospitalization; Hospitals; housing instability; implementation barriers; implementation facilitators; improved; Individual; innovation; Integrated Health Care Systems; interoperability; Intervention; Interview; Lead; Leadership; Life; Light; Link; Measurement; Measures; Medicare; Medicine; Methodology; Minority; Modeling; operation; Outcome; outcome prediction; patient population; Patients; point of care; Population; Positioning Attribute; Predictive Value; Prevalence; Prevention; Primary Health Care; Procedures; Process; racial and ethnic; Recommendation; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Respondent; Rest; Risk; Risk Adjustment; Rural; Rural Health; Sampling; screening; Screening procedure; Shapes; social; social factors; social health determinants; Social isolation; social vulnerability; Surveys; System; Time; Transportation; Trust; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Variant; Veterans; Veterans Health Administration; Woman; Women's Health; Work; ","Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health in High-Risk Veterans","003269","HSR2","HSR-2 Determinants of Patient Response to Care   ","","A2","01","","","",""

Veterans with amputations have unique, unmet needs given additional co- morbidities.

The outcome of this research is expected to facilitate the design of a longitudinal cohort study of retinal biomarker changes in AD, which will determine which retinal biomarkers are sensitive and specific at each stage of AD.","15719761; ","ALBER, JESSICA ;","ST HILLAIRE-CLARKE, CORYSE","09/30/2021","08/31/2023","Address; Adult Children; Age; Alzheimer disease screening; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease risk; Alzheimer?s disease biomarker; Amyloid beta-Protein; Area; autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Brain; Cerebral cortex; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Cerebrum; Clinic; Clinical; cohort; combat; Control Groups; cost; cost efficient; Data; Deposition; design; Detection; Development; Disease; DNA Sequence Alteration; Elderly; Evaluation; Foundations; functional loss; Fundus; ganglion cell; General Population; genetic pedigree; Goals; Gold; Hereditary Disease; Human; Image; Impaired cognition; Inclusion Bodies; Individual; Infrastructure; Inherited; Inner Plexiform Layer; Lasers; Longitudinal cohort study; Longitudinal Studies; macula; Measures; medical specialties; Methods; Morphology; Mutation; mutation carrier; Neuraxis; Neurobiology; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; Ophthalmic examination and evaluation; Ophthalmology; Ophthalmoscopy; Optical Coherence Tomography; Optometry; Outcomes Research; Participant; Pathologic; Pathology; Penetrance; performance site; Phase; Pilot Projects; point of care; Population; population based; Positron-Emission Tomography; pre-clinical; prevent; Protocols documentation; Public Health; Research; Research Personnel; Retina; Retinal Diseases; retinal imaging; retinal nerve fiber layer; Risk; Risk Assessment; routine screening; Scanning; screening; Secondary Prevention; Specialist; specific biomarkers; Standardization; Structure; Surface; Symptoms; targeted biomarker; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Thick; Validation; Visit; Visual; Work; ?-amyloid burden; ","Development of Retinal Biomarkers in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease: A pilot study","074153","CNN","Clinical Neuroscience and Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","01","316239","142657","458896",""

Blood would flow through a dialysis-like membrane harvester that harvests glucose (aka blood sugar) molecules in the blood stream. These sugar molecules would be the fuel source for an alkaline fuel cell. External circuits with super-capacitors and/or rechargeable batteries would enable power management for wearable devices. As a first step toward this goal of a fully implantable system, we propose to develop under this SPiRE an external glucose/sugar-based fuel cell as a technology demonstrator of our larger vision. Such a system has potential advantages over standard battery technology in terms of energy density, size, and weight but more importantly would allow us to research the issues surrounding these power sources. 1","7586913; ","WEIR, RICHARD FERGUS FFRENCH;","","10/01/2020","09/30/2022","Acids; Address; alkalinity; Animal Experimentation; Anions; Anodes; Architecture; Area; Arteriovenous fistula; Award; Baclofen; base; biomaterial compatibility; Blood; Blood flow; Blood Glucose; Blood Vessels; Brain; catalyst; Cathodes; Cells; Clinical; Collaborations; deep brain stimulator; density; design; Development; Device or Instrument Development; Devices; Dialysis patients; Dialysis procedure; Drops; Electricity; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electronics; energy density; Ensure; Equipment; experience; experimental study; Forearm; Formulation; Future; Glucose; glucose transport; Goals; Goretex; Harvest; Hour; Human; Implant; implanted sensor; improved; in vivo; Information Dissemination; Institutes; Journals; Label; light weight; Limb Prosthesis; materials science; Mechanics; Medical; Medical Device; Membrane; Metals; Methods; Miniaturization; miniaturize; Mission; Nature; new technology; novel; Output; oxidation; Pacemakers; Patients; Peer Review; Physiological; Polymers; Power Sources; Production; Property; Prosthesis; Protons; prototype; Pump; reaction rate; Regulation; rehabilitation research; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Peer Review; Route; Shapes; Shunt Device; Solid; Source; standard of care; Stream; sugar; Surface; Surgeon; symposium; System; Technical Expertise; Technology; technology validation; TimeLine; Upper Extremity; Vascular blood supply; Venous; Vision; warfighter; wearable device; wearable sensor technology; Weight; Wireless Technology; Work; wound; ","Power Hungry: Fuel Cells Harvesting Biofluids for Renewable Power of Wearable Medical Devices","003471","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","02","","","",""

In addition, the findings from this study will be a valuable addition to the literature, as there is no evidence regarding the economic value of XR-B and limited evidence regarding the economic value of XR-NTX for opioid use disorder with a jail population.","8544735 (contact); 9736561; ","GORDON, MICHAEL SCOTT (contact); MITCHELL, SHANNON GWIN;","MULFORD, CARRIE FRIED","07/15/2019","04/30/2024","acceptability and feasibility; Adherence; Administrator; Adverse event; Agonist; AIDS/HIV problem; Area; arm; Award; Buprenorphine; Clinical; Communities; comparative effectiveness trial; Continuity of Patient Care; cost; County; Crime; Criminal Justice; Death Rate; disorder later incidence prevention; Drug usage; economic value; Effectiveness; effectiveness evaluation; effectiveness implementation study; effectiveness implementation trial; Ensure; Epidemic; Event; FDA approved; Formulation; Funding; Gender; Health Personnel; Health system; heroin use; HIV risk; illicit opioid; implementation facilitation; Imprisonment; Individual; Infection; Injectable; Injections; innovation; Intervention; Intramuscular; Jail; Learning; Letters; Literature; Maryland; medication compliance; men; Mental Health; Methadone; Naltrexone; Needles; Opiate Addiction; Opioid; Opioid agonist; opioid use; opioid use disorder; opioid withdrawal; Overdose; overdose death; Patient Self-Report; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; physical conditioning; Population; preference; prescription opioid; prescription opioid misuse; Prevention; primary outcome; Prisoner; Prisons; programs; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; randomized trial; reduced substance use; Regulation; Relapse; Research Design; Risk Behaviors; risk minimization; Safety; scale up; secondary outcome; Sex Behavior; Site; Subcutaneous Injections; Supervision; Test Result; treatment program; Urine; Woman; ","A comparative effectiveness trial of extended release naltrexone versus extended-release buprenorphine with individuals leaving jail","050077","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","113962","51466","165428",""

Each year, approximately 795,000 strokes occur accounting for over half of all acute inpatient neurological admissions across both Veterans Affairs and civilian medical settings. Persons 45-64 years of age now account for approximately half of total stroke care costs, a shift heralding an urgent need for rehabilitation to not only reduce disability and attendant costs of care, but optimize stroke recovery for persons in the productive and vital years of their lives. As a result, there is a critical need to identify rehabilitation methods that promote genuine recovery. The current proposal investigates methods to optimize induction of neuroplasticity in an effort to enhance walking function in Veterans following stroke.

Despite recent advances in the treatment of melanoma, existing therapies are not able to fully manage melanoma incidences or fatalities. Therefore, new molecular targets and treatments will be required to effectively manage this cancer. The goal of this study is to define the role and mechanism of the protein SIRT6 in melanoma. SIRT6 plays complex roles in several other types of cancer, but its function in melanoma has not been fully established. We will investigate the role of SIRT6 and the therapeutic significance of inhibiting SIRT6 ? alone and in combination with existing melanoma therapies ? in several clinically-relevant models.

Here, we propose the use of photoacoustic imaging as a novel tool to study the effects of fentanyl on brain function in an animal model of drug taking behavior with excellent resolution. Fentanyl use is a serious mental health problem in the United States and responsible for the sharp increase in overdose deaths observed in the third wave of the opioid epidemic. It is thought that fentanyl acts similarly to other opioids and drugs of abuse to change brain function that facilitates compulsive drug taking, but this remains to be shown. This project will address the research gap on understanding the actions of fentanyl and incorporate a highly innovative neuroimaging method into preclinical studies on the neurobiology of addiction.","11282975; 8877411 (contact); ","AVANAKI, KAMRAN ; PERRINE, SHANE ALAN (contact);","BERTON, OLIVIER","09/30/2021","08/31/2023","absorption; Acoustics; addiction; Address; Affect; American; angiogenesis; Animal Model; Animals; Applications Grants; base; Behavior; Biological Models; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain imaging; brain research; chromophore; Cocaine; Cognitive deficits; Complex; Data; density; Drug abuse; Drug Addiction; Drug Modelings; drug of abuse; drug relapse; Female; Fentanyl; Functional disorder; Generations; Healthcare; hemodynamics; Hemoglobin; Human; imaging modality; improved; in vivo; Individual; Informal Social Control; Injections; innovation; LacZ Genes; male; Masks; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Mental Health; Methods; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuronal patterning; Neurons; Noise; novel; Opioid; opioid abuse; Opioid agonist; opioid epidemic; opioid overdose; Optics; overdose death; Oxygen; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; photoacoustic imaging; Play; preclinical study; Prefrontal Cortex; Process; Publishing; Rattus; Relapse; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; response; Rodent Model; Role; Schedule; Self Administration; sex; Signal Transduction; synthetic opioid; Techniques; temporal measurement; tool; Transgenic Organisms; United States; vascular factor; Vascularization; Vasodilation; ","In vivo photoacoustic imaging of prefrontal cortex in rats undergoing fentanyl self-administration","052657","NMB","Neurobiology of Motivated Behavior Study Section ","","","01","150000","72274","222274",""

Sleep disruption in PTSD is very common and hyperarousal features of PTSD have a bidirectional relationship to sleep problems. Current treatment options have limited efficacy. Further, pharmacological treatments for poor sleep quality often deleteriously affect sleep architecture and may also be addictive. We will examine the efficacy of a non-invasive treatment option called transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) to improve sleep architecture (aim 1), hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD (aim 2), and predictors of individual differences in response (e.g., mild TBI features) (aim 3). tVNS is promising because the vagus nerve affects brain structures that underlie core hyperarousal PTSD symptoms. Preliminary data in animals and humans suggest efficacy in reducing hyperarousal symptoms and increasing restorative sleep quality.

Finally, the ability of the NIHTB-CB to detect improvement related to treatment will be evaluated in a controlled trial of a medication known to improve attention and behavior in IDD.","7846856; ","HESSL, DAVID R;","KAU, ALICE S","09/22/2014","09/29/2025","Adaptive Behaviors; Administrative Supplement; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Assessment tool; Attention; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism spectrum disorder; base; Behavior; Biological Markers; Blood specimen; Child; clinical outcome measures; Clinical Trials; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive change; cognitive testing; cohort; Collaborations; Collection; comparative; Concept Formation; Crystallization; Data; Data Collection; data standards; Dementia; Deterioration; Development; Disease; Double-Blind Method; Down Syndrome; Elderly; Episodic memory; Executive Dysfunction; executive function; experience; falls; feasibility testing; flexibility; Fragile X Syndrome; Funding; Future; Goals; Growth; high risk; Impaired cognition; improved; Individual; Infant; Intellectual functioning disability; Intervention; intervention effect; Knowledge; Language; Language Disorders; Liquid substance; Longitudinal Studies; mathematical ability; Measurement; Measures; Memory; mental age; Modification; Natural History; Nerve Degeneration; Outcome; Participant; Patients; Performance; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Placebo Effect; Placebos; Population; population based; primary outcome; Process; processing speed; Property; Psychometrics; Randomized; Reading; Research; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Ritalin; Sampling; Severities; Short-Term Memory; Standardization; Subgroup; Syndrome; Testing; Time; Toddler; United States National Institutes of Health; Validation; Validity and Reliability; Vocabulary; Work; young adult; ","A Cognitive Test Battery for Intellectual Disabilities","076189","CPDD","Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section ","","S1","07","694015","80731","774746",""

Veterans returning from the Gulf War are at increased risk of fibromyalgia, and many treatment options for fibromyalgia are either inadequate or have harmful side effects. PENFS (percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation) is an FDA-approved therapy similar to acupuncture applied to the external ear. It is currently utilized within the military and VA system, but needs to be further investigated. One way to investigate pain and pain relief is to use a special kind of MRI called resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to evaluate changes in brain activity at rest. Using rs-fcMRI to understand whether PENFS works and how it works could lead to improvements in pain management and quality of life, reduced dependence on opioids, and development of new techniques to address and assess pain.","11252047; ","WOODBURY, ANNA ;","","10/01/2019","09/30/2024","Acupuncture Therapy; Address; Affect; Aftercare; Age; American; Analgesics; Anxiety; Area; arm; Autonomic nervous system; Award; base; Biological Markers; Brain; Brain region; career; career development; central pain; Chronic; chronic pain; chronic painful condition; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; clinical pain; clinical predictors; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; college; Complex; Consumption; control trial; Controlled Clinical Trials; Controlled Environment; Cranial Nerves; Data; Data Analyses; Dependence; Development; Development Plans; Devices; Diagnosis; Double-Blind Method; double-blind placebo controlled trial; Ear; Educational Curriculum; Environment; experience; experimental study; External Ear; FDA approved; Feasibility Studies; feasibility trial; Female; Fibromyalgia; fibromyalgia pain; fibromyalgia patients; follow-up; Foundations; Functional disorder; functional improvement; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Gender; global health; Grant; Gulf War; Gulf War veteran; Human Resources; imaging approach; improved; Incidence; International; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; Long-Term Effects; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Master of Science; Measurable; Measures; Mentors; Methods; Military Personnel; Moods; Nature; Nerve; neural correlate; Neuroanatomy; Neurocognitive; neuroimaging; neuroimaging marker; Neuronal Plasticity; neurophysiology; neurotransmission; non-opioid analgesic; Nonpharmacologic Therapy; novel; Opioid; opioid epidemic; opioid sparing; opioid use; opioid withdrawal; Outcome; Pain; Pain intensity; Pain management; Pain Measurement; pain outcome; pain processing; Pain quality; pain relief; Pain Research; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Placebo Control; Placebos; Prediction of Response to Therapy; predictive marker; primary outcome; Quality of life; Randomized; Registries; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Personnel; responders and non-responders; Rest; Rheumatology; Risk; Scientist; secondary outcome; Series; side effect; skills; Sleep; Sleeplessness; symposium; Symptoms; Synapses; Syndrome; System; Techniques; Testing; Time; tool; Training; treatment effect; Treatment outcome; treatment response; trend; Universities; Variant; Veterans; Visual; Work; ","Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial: fMRI Assessment of Cranial Electrical Stimulation for Fibromyalgia in Veterans","003227","RRD8","Career Development Program - Panel I ","","","03","","","",""

Together, these veterans are among the 623,000 Americans who live with a major lower limb amputation [4]. Some of these veterans will wear a lower limb prosthesis while carrying infants, toddlers or other loads but, unlike the natural limb, most if not all their prostheses are unable to adapt to changes in weight-bearing loads resulting in undesirable compensatory responses.

Early in AMD progression, the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that support the retina are lost and this continues until the retina no longer functions at which time vision is lost. We discovered an adult stem cell present in the RPE (RPESC) and found that transplantation of RPESC rescues vision in an animal model of AMD. The RPESC uniquely allows transplantation of RPE progenitor cells found to be more effective at preserving vision than fully developed RPE. We plan to carry out a sound clinical trial to translate these encouraging preclinical findings into therapy for AMD patients.","9868896; ","STERN, JEFFREY H;","LIBERMAN, ELLEN S","09/30/2020","09/30/2024","Adult; adult stem cell; Age related macular degeneration; aging population; Amendment; Animal Model; Atrophic; base; Blindness; Caring; catalyst; Cell Differentiation process; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; clinical research site; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Collection; college; Communication; Conduct Clinical Trials; Consent; Consent Forms; Cyclic GMP; Data; Data Collection; data management; design; early phase clinical trial; effective therapy; Elderly; Engraftment; Enrollment; Ensure; epithelial stem cell; experience; experimental study; Eye; eye center; Genotype; Grant; improved; Institutes; Institutional Review Boards; Interruption; Intervention; Investigation; Maintenance; Manuals; Manuscripts; Measures; Medical; Michigan; Modeling; Modification; Monitor; Nature; nerve stem cell; Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration; novel therapeutics; operation; Outcome; Outcome Assessment; Pamphlets; Participant; Pathogenesis; Patient Recruitments; Patients; Phase; Phenotype; Pluripotent Stem Cells; post intervention; pre-clinical; preservation; Procedures; progenitor; programs; Protocols documentation; quality assurance; Rattus; recruit; Regenerative Medicine; repaired; Replacement Therapy; Reporting; Research Personnel; Retina; retina transplantation; retinal progenitor cell; Review Committee; Risk; Safety; Site; sound; Source; Specialist; stem cell biology; Stem Cell Research; Stem cell transplant; stem cells; Structure of retinal pigment epithelium; Supporting Cell; Surgeon; Time; Tissues; transcriptome; transcriptomics; Translating; Translations; Transplantation; trial design; tumor; tumor growth; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vision; Work; ","Phase1/2a Clinical Trial of RPESC-derived RPE Transplantation as Therapy for Non-exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration","031810","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","371145","267224","638369",""

More than 90% of patients are women. Our research is investigating why lupus has a predilection for women. Men should have one X and women should have 2. However, our work shows that men with 2 X chromosomes are at the same lupus risk as women, and women with 3 are at an even higher risk for lupus. So, we think that the risk of lupus is related to the number of X chromosomes, not sex. Furthermore, we have identified several genes on the X chromosome that we think may mediate this X chromosome dose effect. This proposal will determine the role of these genes in lupus and the sex bias of the disease. Lupus is a common illness among otherwise healthy young adults. Thus, lupus is frequently diagnosed among military personnel and leads to a medical discharge in most individuals.

Up to 90% of SCI patients, experience clinically significant spasticity, which can disrupt rehabilitation, negatively impact quality-of-life, and worsen other SCI complications. Current spasticity management strategies are palliative, and available treatment options carry high risk for adverse effects due to non-specific action or long-term use, e.g., baclofen, Botox. Thus, a major hurdle facing the development of better treatments for SCI-induced spasticity is a lack of mechanistic insight into how injury leads to disability. Findings from this study would improve our mechanistic understanding of spasticity and advance the field toward clinical application. Finally, this project may yield information that could potentially extend beyond SCI, to conditions such as MS, TBI, and stroke that are also widely prevalent medical issues among US Veterans. !","9097221; ","TAN, ANDREW MICHAEL;","","10/01/2019","09/30/2023","Address; Adverse effects; Anatomy; Astrocytes; astrogliosis; attenuation; Baclofen; base; behavior test; Botox; Brain; chronic neurologic disease; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; clinical translation; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; conditional knockout; cost; Custom; Dendritic Spines; Dependovirus; Development; disability; Disease; Dose-Limiting; druggable target; effectiveness evaluation; Electrophysiology (science); evidence base; experience; experimental study; FDA approved; flexibility; Future; gene therapy; Goals; H-Reflex; high risk; Human; Hygiene; Image Analysis; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; insight; Investigation; knock-down; Knock-out; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Molecular; Monitor; Motor; Motor Neurons; nervous system disorder; Neurons; Output; painful neuropathy; palliative; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; prevent; Proteins; Quality of life; recombinase-mediated cassette exchange; Reflex action; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; restoration; side effect; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; spasticity; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; Spinal cord injury patients; spinal reflex; Stroke; synaptic function; Synaptic plasticity; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; translational study; United States; Veterans; Viral; web site; Work; ","Deconstructing Spasticity after Spinal Cord Injury","002969","RRDA","Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders & Neuropathic Pain ","","","03","","","",""

Skeletal muscle function and health are severely reduced after SCI and this is associated with negative health factors such as insulin resistance, inflammation and obesity. Protecting mitochondrial health after paralysis may be a way to preserve muscle health after SCI. There are no FDA-approved treatments to preserve mitochondrial health.

SCIP included public reporting of evidenced-based antimicrobial guideline compliance metrics in high-risk surgeries and led to high rates of adoption of evidence-based practices (>95%). The program was retired in 2015, as the manual measurement and reporting process was costly with limited expected additional benefit. This IIR will use novel electronic algorithms to measure compliance with SCIP metrics over time, and stakeholder feedback to identify intervention strategies to sustain compliance.

To elucidate this issue, mixed methods will be used to code and analyze 102 MI and 102 HE sessions from a large community RCT to examine the relationship between key aspects of client language, including statements reflecting plans to change (?change talk?) and evidence of client learning (?learning talk?), and 3- and 6-month treatment outcomes.

A Veteran?s life basically stops when a pressure injury develops and must be placed on hold until it heals. Continued high incidence and increasing healthcare care costs indicate an ongoing need for innovative, effective interventions and technology to ensure the highest standards of healthcare for all Veterans.

The goal of this grant is to understand the physiological and cognitive basis of false memories and their clinical and functional implications in daily life.

Cumulative susceptibility reports based on patient cultures, known as antibiograms, are increasingly used in NHs to help guide empiric antibiotic decisions. Most NHs collect an insufficient number of cultures to permit development of a facility-specific antibiogram. In this study, we propose to develop and evaluate an alternative approach to characterizing local susceptibility patterns in NHs, called a weighted incidence syndromic combined antibiogram (WISCA). This work will also lead to the development of a toolkit to support the implementation and evaluation of WISCAs in NHs. Outcomes from this work will help support future studies examining the effects of WISCAs on antibiotic decisions in NHs.

Non-invasive biomarkers will be critical for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for VCID. In response to RFA-NS-21-005, a strong partnership between Washington University School of Medicine and the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center (WU-UTSW) has been developed to serve as a new site for the Small Vessel VCID Consortium. Because VCID sits at the interface between cerebrovascular risk and age-related dementia, this partnership leverages strengths in both the cerebrovascular and Alzheimer?s disease (AD) research infrastructures at WU and UTSW. We have assembled a group of stroke and AD clinicians, clinical investigators, and scientists that that have diverse expertise in VCID and AD pathobiology, clinical trials implementation and management, fluid biomarker collection and measurement, MR image acquisition and processing, informatics and data sharing, and statistics. The collective expertise of the WU-UTSW group will not only permit the implementation of the current VCID biomarker study, but will also provide unique proficiencies in refining the design of the current and future biomarker studies for VCID.","8590500; 9733576; 8268092 (contact); ","AN, HONGYU ; FORD, ANDRIA LEE; LEE, JIN-MOO  (contact);","MCGAVERN, LINDA","09/29/2021","07/31/2023","African American; age related; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease related dementia; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Archives; Area; base; Biological Markers; biomarker validation; biomedical referral center; Blood; Caregivers; cerebrovascular; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cities; Clinical; clinical application; Clinical Investigator; Clinical Research; clinical research site; clinical trial implementation; Cognitive; cohort; Collection; Communities; Data; data sharing; Dementia; design; Development; Diffuse; Endothelium; Enrollment; Ensure; ethnic diversity; follow-up; Future; Goals; Grant; Growth; high risk; Hispanics; Image; image archival system; Impaired cognition; Informatics; Infrastructure; Institution; Light; Liquid substance; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnetic resonance imaging biomarker; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; medical schools; metropolitan; Network-based; neurofilament; neuroimaging; Neurosciences; Participant; Patients; PGF gene; Phenotype; Physiologic pulse; Plasma; Population; Prevention strategy; Procedures; Process; Protocols documentation; racial and ethnic; racial diversity; recruit; repository; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Rural; Scanning; Scientist; serial imaging; sharing platform; Signal Transduction; Site; Skeleton; socioeconomic diversity; socioeconomics; statistics; Stroke; Stroke Belt; stroke risk; success; tertiary care; Texas; treatment strategy; Underrepresented Minority; Universities; Validation; vascular cognitive impairment and dementia; Vascular Dementia; Washington; Water; White Matter Hyperintensity; ","Washington University University of Texas Southwestern VCID Consortium Site","125512","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","1884810","650315","2535125",""

Thus, determining whether statins can preserve physical function and independence in older adults is needed to inform treatment guidelines for the use of statins in older adults.","8616259; ","HOUSTON, DENISE KATHRYN;","ROMASHKAN, SERGEI","09/30/2021","05/31/2026","Activities of Daily Living; Admission activity; Affect; Age; aged; Aging; aging population; Ancillary Study; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; atorvastatin; Cholesterol; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials Design; Cognition; Coronary heart disease; cost effective; Data; Dementia; design; disability; effective therapy; Elderly; Equilibrium; Evaluation; Event; experience; Fatigue; follow-up; functional decline; Gait speed; Health; Health Personnel; Heart failure; immunoregulation; improved; Infrastructure; Lead; Lipids; Lower Extremity; Measures; meter; middle age; mortality; multiple chronic conditions; Muscle; muscle form; Muscle Weakness; Myalgia; Myocardial Infarction; Nursing Homes; Observational Study; Outcome; Pain; Parents; Participant; patient oriented; patient population; Patient Recruitments; Patient Self-Report; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Performance; Peripheral arterial disease; Physical activity; Physical Function; Physical Performance; physically handicapped; Placebos; Pragmatic clinical trial; preservation; prevent; Property; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reporting; Resources; Risk; Series; side effect; Site; Stroke; symptom treatment; Symptoms; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; treatment arm; treatment group; treatment guidelines; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Walking; ","The PREVENTABLE Physical Performance Ancillary Study","071807","NAME","Neurological, Aging and Musculoskeletal Epidemiology ","","A1","01","340182","187100","527282",""

While a great deal of study has been done on the roles of miRNA in AD, these have generally not investigated the metabolic functions of miRNAs; however, we have recently discovered an miRNA, miR346, which stimulates APP translation but does so as part of cellular iron (Fe) homeostasis; therefore, we propose studying specific interactions among miR346, Fe homeostasis, tau protein, and an additional miRNA (miR298) to elucidate both the normal and pathogenic roles of miRNAs in Fe homeostasis in the brain. This proposal is significant by identifying specific novel physiological roles for miR346 and miR298 and elucidating novel regulatory mechanisms associated with AD pathology, specifically potential synergy of APP and tau in a vital cellular function and their co-regulation by common miRNA species, pointing to potential ?one bullet, two target? approaches where treatment by a single substance could restore normal levels of multiple proteins and readjust affected pathways in AD.","1866749; ","LAHIRI, DEBOMOY K;","OPANASHUK, LISA A","09/30/2021","08/31/2022","3' Untranslated Regions; 5' Untranslated Regions; Affect; age related; Alzheimer like pathology; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease brain; Alzheimer's disease model; Alzheimer's disease pathology; Alzheimer's disease patient; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Anatomy; Attention; balance testing; Binding; Biological; Brain; Brain region; Cell physiology; chelation; Cities; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; crosslink; Data; Dementia; Diagnostic; Disease; Elements; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Eye; Failure; gene product; Goals; Homeostasis; Immunoprecipitation; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Iron; iron metabolism; Lead; man; MAPT gene; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; MicroRNAs; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; neurobiological mechanism; Neurobiology; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurotoxicity; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; outcome prediction; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Pharmacology; Physiological; Play; prevent; protein expression; Proteins; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; Reporter; Research; response; Role; Sampling; Site; Supplementation; symptomatic improvement; Symptoms; synergism; System; tau expression; tau Proteins; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; tool; Transgenic Mice; transgenic model of alzheimer disease; Translating; Translations; Untranslated Regions; Untranslated RNA; Wild Type Mouse; ","Role of microRNA in regulating Fe, Amyloid, and Tau (FeAT) in Alzheimer's disease","072810","CDIN","Cell Death in Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","01","398809","231360","630169",""

We collected longitudinal data from two urban samples at high risk for weapons crimes and gun violence exposure (Flint, MI, and Jersey City, NJ), covering developmental periods from age 7 to 27. Because we used similar measures in both studies (e.g., violence/weapon exposure, social cognitions about violence and weapon exposure, violent and weapon-related behavior), we can use a robust approach to integrating data across the samples to understand how risk factors for gun violence at multiple levels of the social context (including gun violence at the neighborhood level) affect the development of violence-related and weapons-related social cognitions, that in turn shape use of guns and other weapons into early adulthood.

During that time, numerous facilities, both government and privately-owned, were constructed or leased across the country to support the effort, generating large quantities of radioactive and hazardous materials that resulted in the contamination of many of the facilities and surrounding areas.  In 1994, to protect the staff and workers doing DOE cleanup and waste management work, legislation was enacted to allow the Department of Energy to fund NIEHS to develop Worker Training programs that would assure workers, other facility personnel, and community responders the knowledge and skills to protect themselves and their communities from hazardous conditions in the workplace.  The National Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE) and its Community College Consortium for Health and Safety Training (CCCHST) has been continuously supported by NIEHS since 1995 to provide quality training that is efficient, consistent, flexible, and cost-effective for the multiple tiers of contractors at DOE sites including the Oakridge complex, Pantex, the Savannah River Site, with Los Alamos National Lab soon to be added, annually providing 7,000 students with 400 courses for a total 50,000 contact hours of training, with an average 75 courses delivered online.","78360389; ","NASH, WILLIAM KESTER;","REMINGTON, JAMES W","09/15/2010","07/31/2025","Advisory Committees; Area; Award; chemical disaster; college; Communities; community college; Complex; Contractor; cost effective; Country; Data; Data Management Resources; Decontamination; Department of Energy; Education; Educational Curriculum; Emergency response; Evaluation; Exposure to; flexibility; Funding; Goals; Government; Hazardous Substances; Hazardous Waste; Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response; Hazardous Waste Sites; Health; Hour; Human Resources; Knowledge; Laboratories; Mediating; member; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Nuclear Weapon; Nuclear Weapons Testings; online delivery; operation; Production; Quality Control; Radioactive; Research; response; restoration; Rivers; Safety; Site; skills; Statutes and Laws; student training; Students; technical college; Technology; Tennessee; Time; Training; Training Programs; Transportation; Universities; virtual; Waste Management; wasting; Work; Workplace; ","HAZMAT Training at DOE Nuclear Weapons Complex","019338","ZES1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","12","1077636","23937","1101573",""

The proposed research program will complete manufacturing and clinical trial activities necessary to evaluate and support approval of a pediatric-appropriate formulation of lofexidine, a non-opioid medication approved for mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms in adults, as a first line-therapy in NOWS patients through 2 clinical trials to i) identify an optimal dosing regimen of lofexidine for treatment of NOWS and ii) evaluate the risks and benefits of its use in improving withdrawal symptoms, limiting infant exposure to other off-label narcotic medications and shortening the infant?s overall stay in the hospital.","15430214 (contact); 77960037; ","GULLO, KRISTEN LEANN (contact); SEBURG, RANDAL ;","HERRMANN, EVAN SULLIVAN","09/30/2021","08/31/2023","Adrenergic Agonists; Adult; Adverse event; Affect; American; base; Benefits and Risks; Biological Availability; Birth; Blood specimen; Brain; care costs; Caring; Chemistry; Child; Childhood; Clinical; clinical development; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees; cohort; Collaborations; cost; Cytoplasmic Granules; Data; Databases; design; Development; Distress; Dose; Double-Blind Method; Drug Kinetics; effectiveness measure; efficacy evaluation; efficacy study; efficacy trial; Electrocardiogram; Enrollment; Epidemic; Evaluation; Exposure to; Formulation; Funding; General Population; GMP lots; Goals; Health Care Costs; Healthcare Systems; Hospitalization; Hospitals; improved; in utero; Incidence; Infant; inpatient service; Inpatients; Investigation; Label; Length; Length of Stay; lofexidine; Measures; Monitor; Morphine; Narcotics; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Neonatal; Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; neonate; neurodevelopment; non-opioid analgesic; novel therapeutics; off-label use; open label; Opioid; opioid abuse; opioid epidemic; opioid therapy; opioid use; opioid use disorder; opioid withdrawal; Oral; Orphan; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pharmacokinetic model; Pharmacological Treatment; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; placebo controlled study; Population; Pregnant Women; Process; Production; Program Development; programs; public health emergency; Publishing; Randomized; Recommendation; Regimen; Reporting; Research; research clinical testing; Research Design; response; Risk; Safety; safety assessment; safety study; Sample Size; scale up; Severities; Signs and Symptoms; Site; standard of care; Symptoms; System; Tablets; Technology Transfer; Treatment Protocols; treatment risk; United States Food and Drug Administration; Ventilatory Depression; volunteer; Weight; Withdrawal Symptom; Work; ","Development of Lofexidine as a First-line Non-Opioid Pharmacologic Treatment for Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome","054799","NIDA","Training and Career Development Subcommittee ","","","01","4282651","1070663","5353314",""

Similarly, diabetes affects roughly 10% of the general population, but 25% of veterans. The average age of the veteran population (58 years old) is much older than the general population (38 years old) and likely contributes to the higher prevalence of these foot pathologies.

Moreover, the number of obese older veterans has markedly increased because of both the increase in the aging of the veteran population and the percentage of older veterans who are obese. In older veterans, obesity aggravates the age-related decline in physical function resulting in frailty that leads to loss of independence in activities of daily living. However, lifestyle therapy resulting in weight loss in obese older adults remains controversial because of concerns about harmful effects of weight loss on muscle and bone mass in this population. Metformin, a drug widely used to treat diabetes, could slow the aging process and improve health span, the part of a person?s life during which they are in good health. It is possible that the addition of metformin to lifestyle therapy will reverse frailty and preserve muscle and bone mass in obese older veterans, thereby prevent their loss of independence and decrease need for admission to a VA nursing home care.","6487786; ","VILLAREAL, DENNIS T.;","","10/01/2020","09/30/2025","Activities of Daily Living; Admission activity; adult obesity; Affect; Age; age related; Aging; Anabolism; Animals; base; Biguanides; Blood; Body mass index; Body Weight decreased; bone; Bone Density; bone mass; bone quality; Cell Aging; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; comparative efficacy; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Drug usage; Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; Elderly; Exercise; exercise training; Failure; Finite Element Analysis; Frail Elderly; frailty; functional independence; functional loss; functional outcomes; functional status; Future; Gait speed; General Population; Goals; Head; head-to-head comparison; Health; health care service; Health Personnel; Healthcare Systems; healthspan; high risk population; Home Nursing Care; Human; human old age (65+); Immunohistochemistry; Impairment; improved; Intervention; lean body mass; Length; Life; lifestyle intervention; Lifestyle Therapy; Longevity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mediating; Medical; Metformin; military veteran; mortality; multi-component intervention; Muscle; muscle form; muscle strength; Muscular Atrophy; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Nursing Homes; obese patients; Obesity; Obesity Epidemic; Observational Study; older patient; Older Population; Oral; Osteopenia; Outcome; Overweight; Performance; performance tests; Peripheral; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Physical Function; Physical Performance; Placebos; Population; preservation; Prevalence; prevent; Process; programs; Quality of life; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reporting; Resolution; response; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk; sarcopenia; sarcopenic obesity; secondary analysis; senescence; Skeletal Muscle; standard care; standard of care; telomere; Testing; Thigh structure; treatment group; Uncertainty; Veterans; Veterans Health Administration; Weight Gain; Weight maintenance regimen; Western Blotting; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Lifestyle Intervention plus Metformin to Treat Frailty in Older Veterans with Obesity","002161","ZRD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","",""

The platform includes the population-based health and demographic surveillance systems, laboratories, clinical research centers, offices, and shared services. Following extensive discussions with KEMRI that led to this joint application, we agreed to implement a highly cost-effective management plan that develops strong organizational capacities within KEMRI, which is required to assume successful and sustainable management of the KRP infrastructure in support of their public health research in Kenya. In addition, we demonstrate clear technical expertise to lead the Research Core areas identified in the RFA, using the same approach of twinning experienced WSU and LSTM scientists with KEMRI and CDC counterparts to design, implement, and publish finding from the studies, an approach designed to train and mentor KEMRI scientists in applying and managing research funding.","1975552; ","NJENGA, M KARIUKI;","","09/30/2021","09/29/2026","","GH21-003, Advancing Public Health Research in Kenya","002346","ZGH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","6329348",""

Pain resulting from injury to the spinal cord is one of the most common and refractory symptoms following an SCI. Few treatments are available and none are fully effective in relieving SCI related pain, which reduces quality of life. In addition, the available medications have side effects such as drowsiness. The current research investigates the possibility that a naturally occurring compound relieves SCI-related pain due to injuries to the spinal cord. If successful, this research would make available a new class of medications that specifically target the cellular mechanism responsible for such pain offering the possibility of treating such pain more completely and with fewer side effects.

Because widescale screening for CRE colonization remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals, hospitals miss critical opportunities to identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when it is still possible to prevent deleterious patient outcomes. We propose to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients by: (a) developing and validating natural language processing classifiers to detect established and new CRE risk factors from free-text, narrative EHR data; (b) using NLP-derived variables with EHR structured data to predict CRE colonization at admission; and (c) developing machine learning-based models to predict which CRE-colonized patients will progress to infection during the hospital stay, in order to guide precision medicine-based approaches for interventions.","14296775; ","GOODMAN, KATHERINE ELIZABETH;","WILLIS, TAMARA","09/30/2021","09/29/2026","","Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection","028363","HCRT","Healthcare Research Training  ","","A1","01","","","130277",""

Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), over the last decade there have been nearly 90,000 inpatient or outpatient visits for HR?a 2.3-fold increase over that time. This joint bears loads greater than body weight with each step and can be very painful when it becomes stiff and arthritic. Patients often find non-surgical (e.g., footwear-based) treatments ineffective, while surgical treatments, which either increase motion of the joint (e.g., remove excess bone), restrict the joint (i.e., fuse the two bones comprising the joint), or replace the joint (i.e., implant new mating surfaces), have all been unsatisfactory. The proposed study will characterize healthy and pathologic great toe joint motion, determine the effectiveness of total joint replacements (including a new design developed by our group) at restoring normal motion, and refine our tools that inform improved design of these implants.","8428824; ","LEDOUX, WILLIAM R.;","","10/01/2020","09/30/2024","3-Dimensional; Activities of Daily Living; Address; Adult; Affect; Age; American; Ankle; Arthritis; Arthrodesis; arthropathies; Articular Range of Motion; base; Biomechanics; Body Weight; bone; Bone Spur; Cadaver; Cartilage; Classification; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Complication; Computer Models; cortical bone; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; design; Development; Device Designs; Devices; Disease; Dorsal; effectiveness evaluation; effectiveness measure; Elderly; Elements; Environment; evidence base; Exhibits; experience; Failure; Female; Fluoroscopy; foot; Foundations; functional outcomes; Gait; gait examination; Goals; Guidelines; Hallux Rigidus; Head; Hip region structure; hip replacement arthroplasty; Hour; Human; human subject; Implant; implant design; improved; Incidence; Individual; ineffective therapies; Inpatients; insight; instrument; Interphalangeal joint of toe; Intervention; iterative design; joint function; joint loading; Joints; kinematics; Kinetics; Knee; Knee joint; knee replacement arthroplasty; Knowledge; Lead; Literature; Locomotion; male; Mechanics; Metatarsal bone structure; Metatarsalgia; Metatarsophalangeal joint structure; Methods; migration; Modeling; Modification; Motion; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal Development; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Osteotomy; Outcome; Outpatients; Pain; Partner in relationship; Pathologic; pathomechanics; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Performance; Physiological; pilates exercise; Population; Positioning Attribute; preservation; Preservation Technique; Prevalence; Process; Property; Prosthesis; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized Controlled Trials; rapid testing; Replacement Arthroplasty; Reporting; Research; Resources; Robotics; sample fixation; Sampling; Secondary to; Shoes; simulation; Site; Stress; success; Surface; Surgeon; systematic review; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; treatment choice; treatment strategy; United States; Ursidae Family; Veterans; Veterans Health Administration; Visit; Walking; Work; Yoga; ","Characterizing and Restoring Joint Motion in Patients with Hallux Rigidus: Human Subject Testing","003259","RRD2","Musculoskeletal Health & Function ","","","02","","","",""

Obesity is a growing epidemic in our country. Obese veterans are at risk for hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Stimulating the vagal and/or splanchnic nerves, which innervate the stomach, with small, therapeutic levels of electricity provides a potential avenue for weight loss, but is not well understood. Successful reduction of excess body weight has been reported, but has been limited to ?select? individuals and, like drugs, there are common side effects, including sensations of bloating, discomfort, abdominal pain, belching, indigestion, and nausea accompanied by vomiting. A new, promising method of stimulation has been shown to produce natural sensations when applied to peripheral nerves and the spinal cord. This research aims to 1) begin to understand the neural code associated with a full stomach and 2) use this new method of stimulation to more effectively reduce excess body weight.

An estimated one in three people who undergo DL do not get well and often undergo repeated surgery.1,3-6 Some studies indicate that conditions outside of the spine (e.g., depression, hip arthritis) cause people who undergo DL to do poorly,27,30-36 but no one has comprehensively examined these conditions or the impact of treating them on DL outcomes. Thus LSS treatment continues to focus on the spine alone.61 The aim of this study is to identify conditions other than LSS that place veterans at risk of poor DL outcomes so that future comparative effectiveness studies can be designed that examine the impact of a more comprehensive approach to treatment.

Viral infections are defended far less effectively by the elderly--- Covid19 for example has been far more lethal to the elderly---suggesting that the coupling of antiviral defense to longevity regulation is likely to be general.","1893782; ","RUVKUN, GARY B;","GUO, MAX","09/30/1999","08/31/2022","Adult; Aging; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amino Acid Sequence; Amyloid beta-Protein; Animals; Anorexia Nervosa; anti aging; Antiviral Agents; Antiviral Response; Asparagine; Aspartic Acid; assault; Autoimmunity; Biology of Aging; Caenorhabditis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosome Pairing; Client; Complex; coronavirus disease; cost; Coupled; Couples; Coupling; COVID-19; Dam methyltransferase; deamidation; Death Rate; Defect; Detection; Dexamethasone; Diagnostic; Dioxygenases; Disease; DNA; DNA Binding Domain; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Dreams; Drug Metabolic Detoxication; Elderly; Elements; Endocrine system; Escherichia coli; Excision; Felis catus; Fruit; fungus; fusion gene; gain of function; Gases; Gene Amplification; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; genetic pedigree; Genetic Recombination; Genetic Screening; genome editing; genome sequencing; Genomic Segment; glycosylation; Homeostasis; Human; human old age (65+); Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Induced Mutation; Informatics; Injections; Intestines; Late-Onset Disorder; Libraries; Ligand Binding Domain; Longevity; Maps; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Methylation; Methyltransferase Gene; microbial; microbiome; microbiota; Migraine; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial genome; mitochondrial membrane; Modification; Molecular; Monitor; mRNA capping; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; Mus; Muscle; mutant; Mutation; mutation screening; Natural Immunity; Nematoda; Neurotransmitters; NF-kappa B; Nuclear Hormone Receptors; Operon; Oxygen; Paralysed; Parkinson Disease; Partial Pressure; pathogenic bacteria; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Analysis; PINK1 gene; Plants; Polyploidy; Process; Production; programs; Protein Kinase; Proteins; Quinones; Receptor Gene; Regulation; Resistance; response; restriction enzyme; RNA; RNA Helicase; RNA Interference; RNA interference screen; Running; screening; Sex Bias; Sirolimus; Small Interfering RNA; Small RNA; sugar; System; Testing; Tissues; transcriptome sequencing; Variant; Viral; Viral N Protein; Viral Proteins; Virus; Virus Diseases; whole genome; young adult; ","Genetic and Molecular Basis of Longevity","016636","CMAD","Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development Study Section ","","","23","205000","139400","344400",""

Understanding the needs of women Veterans with amputation is a priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs, given that there is very little research on this topic, and most of it comes from studies conducted outside of the United States and with civilians.

More than one third of US children are overweight or obese. Intrauterine growth restricted infants are at high risk for the development of obesity and other metabolic diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying developmental programming of childhood obesity are poorly understood; however, epigenomic alterations during fetal life have been proposed to be important regulators of the child's phenotype. Immune cells, including T-cells and monocytes, play a key role in obesity pathogenesis. By studying whether DNA methylation and functional profiles of CD3+ T-cells mediate the association of intrauterine growth restriction with the development of adiposity in the first 24-months of life, we will characterize `obesity risk' stratifying biomarkers of early childhood obesity. Identification of stable biomarkers of `obesity risk' early in life can be used both for prediction of later obesity and to monitor the effects of preventive therapies as well as interventions.","1883558 (contact); 10812436; ","CHARRON, MAUREEN J (contact); FULORIA, MAMTA ;","BREMER, ANDREW","10/01/2021","09/30/2022","Acute; Address; Adipose tissue; Adult; Affect; Age-Months; Anxiety; base; Behavioral; Biological Markers; Birth; Cardiovascular Diseases; CD3 Antigens; CD8B1 gene; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Child Behavior; Child Development; Child Rearing; Child Welfare; Childhood; Chronic; Chronic stress; Cities; Cognitive; cohort; Color; Communities; Coping Skills; coronavirus disease; COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; data infrastructure; Death Rate; Development; DNA Methylation; early childhood; early detection biomarkers; Economics; Emotional; Enrollment; Epidemic; epidemiology study; Epigenetic Process; epigenomics; ethnic diversity; Exposure to; Family; feeding; Feeding behaviors; fetal; Fetal Growth; Fetal Growth Retardation; Gene Expression; Genomic DNA; Gestational Age; Goals; Growth; Hair; Health; health disparity; high risk; high risk population; High-Risk Pregnancy; Hispanics; hospitalization rates; Hydrocortisone; Immune; Individual; Infant; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; insulin sensitivity; Intervention; Knowledge; Length; Life; Light; Link; Low Birth Weight Infant; maternal outcome; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Metabolic Diseases; Molecular; Monitor; monocyte; mortality; Mothers; neonatal morbidity; neonatal outcome; New York; New York City; Newborn Infant; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; obesity biomarkers; obesity development; obesity in children; obesity risk; obstetric outcomes; overweight child; pandemic disease; Parents; Pathogenesis; Pattern; Pediatrics; peripheral blood; Personal Satisfaction; Phenotype; PhenX Toolkit; physical conditioning; Play; Policies; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy Complications; pregnant; Preventive healthcare; Preventive therapy; Process; prospective; Prospective cohort; protective factors; psychologic; psychological distress; public health intervention; public health relevance; Race; racial difference; racism; recruit; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; resilience; Risk; Risk Factors; risk stratification; Role; saliva sample; Sampling; Signal Transduction; social; social health determinants; Social support; Stress; stressor; Structural Racism; Surveys; T-Lymphocyte; telomere; Umbilical Cord Blood; Weight Gain; ","Impact of COVID-19 and Structural Racism on Maternal Mental Health and the Bronx MomBa Cohort","092533","","","","S1","05","199548","135693","335241",""

Using data from two highly regarded, representative national surveys? the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)?we propose to assess the protective effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion on the following outcomes for adults and children following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) health insurance coverage; (2) access to and use of health care, health care expenditures, and financial stress; and (3) health outcomes, including physical and mental health.","8589615; ","ESCARCE, JOSE JULIO;","HELLINGER, FRED","09/30/2021","08/31/2025","","The Medicaid expansion in the age of COVID-19: Effects on coverage, access, use, financial stress, and health.","027970","HSVR","Healthcare Systems and Values Research ","","A1","01","","","386223",""

Approximately 100,000 veterans with PD receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and this number is expected to grow in the coming decades. Inflammation in the brain may play an important role in the progression of these impairments, but we lack easily accessible tools to identify and measure inflammation in the brain. The main goal of this project is to use a novel brain imaging test, diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI), to examine brain inflammation in veterans with PD. We will compare DBSI to other measures of inflammation and use it to predict clinical progression in PD. This will help us understand the role of inflammation in PD and lead to development of a readily-available, noninvasive brain imaging measure of inflammation, which will be useful in clinical trials of agents that target the immune system.","7551841; ","WHITE, ROBERT L;","","10/01/2021","09/30/2025","adaptive immune response; Adaptive Immune System; Affect; age related neurodegeneration; alpha synuclein; Alzheimer's Disease; Anatomy; Animal Model; Astrocytes; Autopsy; axon injury; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Blood; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain imaging; Brain region; brain tissue; Calcium Binding; Calcium ion; Caring; catalyst; Cell Fraction; Cells; Cellularity; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Clinical; clinical application; clinical predictors; Clinical Trials; Clonal Expansion; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive impairment in Parkinson's; Cyclotrons; Data; Dementia; Development; diagnostic biomarker; Diffusion; Disease; Disease Progression; disorder control; dopaminergic neuron; Edema; Elderly; Encephalitis; Evaluation; experience; Flow Cytometry; Formalin; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Gliosis; Goals; Histologic; Histopathology; Hospitals; Human; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; Immune response; Immune system; Immune Targeting; immunohistochemical markers; Immunohistochemistry; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Innate Immune Response; interest; Investigation; Lead; Life; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Microglia; Monitor; Motor; motor disorder; motor symptom; Movement; Multiple Sclerosis; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; neuroimaging; neuroinflammation; neuropathology; new therapeutic target; non-demented; non-motor symptom; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathologic Processes; Pathology; patient stratification; peripheral blood; Phenotype; Play; Population; Positron-Emission Tomography; progressive neurodegeneration; prospective; Proteins; Radiation exposure; recruit; Research; response; Role; Severity of illness; single-cell RNA sequencing; Source; Specimen; spectrograph; Staging; Stains; Standardization; Substantia nigra structure; Surrogate Markers; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; targeted agent; Testing; therapy development; Thinking; Tissues; tool; Tremor; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; United States Food and Drug Administration; Variant; Veterans; ","Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging for Measurement of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson Disease","002316","ZRD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","",""

However, despite this success, Veterans living with HIV are more likely to have age-related diseases and loss of fitness and muscle that place them at increased risk for disability. This is a major priority for the VHA, the largest provider of HIV care in the United States. The goal of this study is to test a circuit exercise program in Veterans living with HIV that is designed to slowdown the aging process.

Increasingly more research highlights the relationship between drug misuse and racial discrimination and race-based trauma symptoms. However, these variables have not been examined in the context of OUD treatment for Black Americans. In the context of a NIDA-funded clinical trial examining Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) for OUD, the present proposal will evaluate how race, race-based discrimination, and race-based trauma symptoms influence OUD severity, treatment engagement (i.e., adherence to OUD medication assisted treatment, MAT), and treatment outcomes (i.e., drug-use). Executing this supplemental research proposal will fill important knowledge gaps by clarifying the role that race-relevant variables play in OUD severity and treatment response and will significantly promote research activities needed to facilitate health equity for Black Americans.","11624836; ","GAWRYSIAK, MICHAEL JOHN;","FITZ-RANDOLPH, MARCY ESTHER","09/30/2020","08/31/2023","addiction; Address; Adherence; Administrative Supplement; African American; Aftercare; Alcohols; Applications Grants; Appointment; Awareness; base; Behavior Therapy; behavioral pharmacology; black patient; caucasian American; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Cocaine; Cognitive Therapy; Collaborations; design; Discrimination; disorder later incidence prevention; disparity reduction; drug misuse; Drug Screening; Drug usage; effective therapy; Enrollment; evidence base; experience; Exposure to; follow up assessment; follow-up; Funding; Future; Group Therapy; health disparity; health equity; health equity promotion; Heterogeneity; Imprisonment; improved; Individual; intervention effect; Knowledge; Link; Measures; Mediating; Medical; medication compliance; medication-assisted treatment; Mental Health; mindfulness; Mindfulness Training; Monitor; Naltrexone; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Opioid; opioid mortality; opioid use; opioid use disorder; Outcome; Outpatients; Parents; Participant; Patient Noncompliance; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Pharmacological Treatment; Play; Preparation; Prevalence; prevent; Procedures; programs; psychiatric symptom; Race; racial discrimination; racial diversity; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Reporting; Research; Research Activity; Research Design; Research Proposals; Residential Treatment; resilience; Role; Schedule; Secure; Self Care; Severities; substance misuse; substance use; Substance Use Disorder; symptomatic improvement; Testing; therapy outcome; Trauma; trauma exposure; trauma symptom; traumatic stress; treatment adherence; treatment as usual; Treatment outcome; treatment program; treatment response; Underrepresented Minority; United States National Institutes of Health; Urine; Vulnerable Populations; ","Mindful MAT Adherence: Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) to improve extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) adherence and drug-use outcomes for opioid use disorder (OUD).","050102","","","","A1S1","01","100903","30264","131167",""

However, across VA nationally, only 39% of LSTDI conversations occur in the outpatient setting; the majority occur in the inpatient setting often close to death. At this late stage, Veterans are often not able to make their preferences known because they are so ill. Decisions fall to surrogates who may be uncertain about what the Veteran would have wanted.

Prevalence is greater among Veterans than in the general population and is increasing dramatically. Women Veterans and blast injury survivors are particularly susceptible. Current treatments work well early, but often fail over time. Given the aging Veteran population, there is thus an urgent need to develop new treatment strategies for late-stage disease. We recently developed a drug, HIOC, to protect against loss of retina ganglion cells due to blast injury. These are the same cells whose death in glaucoma causes blindness. We propose to test whether HIOC protects retina cells and vision in mouse models of glaucoma. As we have done successfully with other drugs we brought to clinical trial, this project is designed to test critical in vivo responses and mechanisms of action that will provide preclinical data in support of our proposing ophthalmic clinical trials of HIOC, a potentially inexpensive and accessible treatment for Veterans suffering from a chronic disease that results in blindness.","1857707; ","BOATRIGHT, JEFFREY H;","","10/01/2018","09/30/2023","Age; aged; Aging; analog; Anterior; Aqueous Humor; Blast Injuries; Blindness; Blood-Retinal Barrier; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; cell killing; Cell physiology; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Clinic; Clinical Trials; compliance behavior; Data; design; Disease; Disease Progression; Dose; effective therapy; epidemiology study; Etiology; experimental study; Eye; General Population; Glaucoma; Half-Life; Health; high risk; Hour; Human; human disease; in vivo; insight; Intraperitoneal Injections; Mediator of activation protein; men; Microspheres; military veteran; Modeling; Monitor; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; nerve damage; neurotrophic factor; Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2; novel strategies; Ocular Hypertension; Optic Nerve; Outcome; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; pigment dispersion syndrome; pre-clinical; Prevalence; Recombinants; Refractory; Reporting; response; Retina; retinal axon; retinal damage; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Risk Factors; small molecule; standard of care; success; Survivors; Testing; Time; Topical application; Toxicology; Translating; treatment strategy; Veterans; Vision; Visual; Visual impairment; Woman; Work; ","A TrkB Activator for Treatment of Glaucoma","002806","RRD3","Sensory Systems & Communication Disorders ","","","04","","","",""

We propose the current study to investigate the mechanism of this loss of functional inhibition and motor control at the neurotransmitter level. The area of research described in the proposed Merit has strong implications relevant to the rehabilitative needs of Veterans as modulation of cortical inhibition is the direct mechanism by which transcranial stimulation techniques take effect. Yet studies employing these techniques to improve motor control have very varied results due to the fact they are being employed on a brain that is aging. This may be because we are stimulating areas that should be inhibited and vice-versa.

Restoration of hearing following conductive hearing loss due to excessive blast- related noises has had limited success, because the hearing field currently has only a rudimentary understanding of how the structures of the middle ear transmit sound under pathological conditions. The studies in the current proposal will significantly advance our knowledge of how middle-ear structures work to accurately transmit sound. By measuring sound-pressure levels and movements of middle-ear structures in normal and damaged ears, we can more precisely diagnose the specific causes of a blast-induced hearing loss, and design and implement more effective surgical methods and replacement prosthetics to optimally restore hearing. The knowledge gained from the proposed research will be of value not only in habilitating military personnel and Veterans, but also for other patients suffering from conductive hearing losses.","8654069; ","DONG, WEI ;","","10/01/2017","09/30/2023","3-Dimensional; Acoustics; active duty; Anatomic Models; Animal Model; Auricular prosthesis; base; bone; Cadaver; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Clinical Treatment; Cochlea; Complex; Conductive hearing loss; Congenital Abnormality; Data; design; Development; Devices; Diagnosis; Dislocations; Ear; Ear Injury; Ear ossicles; Environment; Evaluation; Excision; Exhibits; experience; Experimental Models; Failure; flexibility; Frequencies; Gerbils; Glues; Goals; healing; Hearing; hearing impairment; hearing restoration; Human; improved; Incus; Individual; Injury; Intraoperative Monitoring; Investigation; Knowledge; Labyrinth; Lasers; manubrium; Measurement; Measures; Methods; middle ear; Military Personnel; military veteran; Modeling; Monitor; Morphology; Motion; Movement; Noise; normal hearing; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; otoacoustic emission; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Perforation; physical property; Preparation; pressure; pressure sensor; Procedures; Process; Production; Prosthesis; reconstruction; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; repaired; Research; Residual state; restoration; Role; Rupture; sample fixation; sensor; Services; Soldier; sound; Stapes; Structure; success; Surgical Disarticulation; System; Temporal bone structure; Testing; Time; tool; transmission process; tumor; Tympanic membrane; Tympanic Membrane Perforation; Veterans; vibration; Work; ","Improving Restoration of Middle-Ear Function Following Blast Related Injuries","002296","RRD3","Sensory Systems & Communication Disorders ","","","05","","","",""

Slow walking speed is a frequent patient complaint and is associated with bad health outcomes including disability and death. Physical therapy (PT) care is the usual treatment for older adults with slow gait speed, but the optimal model of PT care is not known. Outside of the VA, we developed Live Long Walk Strong (LLWS) which is a program of PT care that builds upon our research identifying new treatments with greater benefit than usual care. We must confirm that LLWS can benefit Veterans beginning in midlife. We intend to conduct a study of LLLWS among community dwelling Veterans in comparison to usual care. We will evaluate the benefits that LLWS provides on walking skills and the qualities that lead to walking skill improvements. We will also evaluate if the benefits of LLWS last up to 16 weeks after treatment ends. If successful, this study will establish LLWS as a treatment targeting health and functional independence, which can be provided in a variety of VA care settings.","3084754; ","BEAN, JONATHAN F;","","10/01/2019","09/30/2023","Accounting; Address; Advocate; Aftercare; Age; aged; Ambulatory Care Facilities; base; Boston; Caring; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; Communities; comorbidity; design; disability; Disease; efficacious treatment; Elderly; Exercise; falls; functional independence; Funding; Future; Gait; Gender; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; health care settings; Healthcare Systems; High Prevalence; Hospitalization; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; improved mobility; innovation; Lead; Leg; Link; Mediating; middle age; Modeling; Muscle; new therapeutic target; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Outpatients; Pain; Patient Care; Patients; Performance; Phase; Physical activity; physical model; Physical therapy; Prevalence; Preventive care; Primary Health Care; primary outcome; programs; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Readiness; Recording of previous events; recruit; rehabilitation science; Rehabilitation therapy; rehabilitative care; Research; Risk; secondary outcome; Self Efficacy; skills; Speed; standard care; therapeutic target; treatment as usual; treatment duration; treatment effect; United States National Institutes of Health; Veterans; Waiting Lists; Walking; walking speed; Work; ","The Live Long Walk Strong rehabilitation program: What features improve mobility skills?","003095","RRD6","Blank ","","","03","","","",""

We recently developed a first-in-class exclusive eNMDAR antagonist, which puts us in a unique position to directly examine the molecular and functional impacts of the activity of eNMDARs on multiple aspects of AD-related pathology. Building on our proof-of-concept studies showing that exclusive eNMDAR antagonists can provide neuroprotection in several disease models associated with glutamatergic excitoxicity, we propose to test our exclusive eNMDAR antagonist in two complementary AD mouse models.

BioPROVAR is developing BioTremvarTM, a natural protein found in the blood that prevents and inhibits the DEI found in sepsis and ARDS patients and will save thousands of lives every year.","12059397; ","ROUSSEL, EUGENE ;","FULDNER, REBECCA A","09/30/2021","08/31/2022","Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; aged; American; Animal Model; Animals; Antibiotics; Antibodies; Antigens; Bacterial Infections; base; Binding; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood Platelets; Cause of Death; Cavia; cecal ligation puncture; Cells; Cessation of life; cGMP production; Characteristics; Chemicals; Complex; Computer software; COVID-19 mortality; Cyclic GMP; cytokine; cytokine release syndrome; Data; Diagnosis; Disease; Dose; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; efficacy study; Elderly; Enterobacteriaceae; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; experimental study; FDA approved; Fluorescence; Fluorescent Dyes; Formulation; Funding; Genetic Engineering; Goals; Half-Life; Human; Immune response; Immunotherapy; improved; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Intensive Care; intravenous injection; Joints; juvenile animal; Knowledge; Label; Lead; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Lung; macrophage; manufacturing process; Medical emergency; Microbiology; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Monoclonal Antibodies; Mus; Myeloid Cells; neutrophil; Non-Rodent Model; novel therapeutics; older patient; Organ; Organism; pathogenic bacteria; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; Phase; Pichia; pre-clinical; preclinical trial; Preparation; prevent; Probability; Process; Production; Proteins; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; receptor; Receptor Activation; Recombinants; Regimen; Request for Proposals; response; Rights; RNA Splicing; Rodent; Role; Salmonella; Scientist; Sepsis; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; stability testing; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure; Superantigens; Surface; System; systemic inflammatory response; Tail; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; TLR4 gene; Toxicology; Toxin; Treatment Efficacy; Variant; Work; ","An Innovative Immune Therapy with Antibiotics to Treat Deadly Excess Inflammation in Sepsis and ARDS Induced from Severe Bacterial Infection in Geriatric Patients","074105","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","376045",""

Hematologic transplantation (HCT) is a common treatment for these cancers, but often leads to deconditioning, fatigue, muscle atrophy, and poor quality of life, which are associated with complications such as hospitalization and infection. Despite the significance of these symptoms, there are no approved treatments to prevent/reverse these long-term effects. The cancer itself, side effects of chemotherapy, and sedentary behavior, contribute to these effects. Although exercise before and after HCT has helped reduce these effects, it is inconsistently recommended to patients and most remain sedentary through and after treatment.

Sources of excessive expenditures at the end of life include overuse of aggressive treatments unlikely to extend length of life, intensive care unit admissions, emergency room admissions, and other hospital services that may be avoided through early implementation of palliative care services. Early consultation with palliative care is associated with improved quality of life at the end of life, and has been associated with improved quantity of life for certain diagnoses such as advanced cancer. In this context, the American Urological Association (AUA) is working to increase awareness of this issue and provide its members nationwide with an evidence-based action plan to reduce the burden and optimize value of care for those with advanced urological health conditions. As a foundational step, the AUA is convening a multi- stakeholder Quality Improvement Summit to address this topic, bringing together experts from urology, palliative care, broader surgical specialties, psychiatry, and pain management to discuss a variety of topics including: management of the disease course of individuals with advanced benign and malignant urologic diseases, identification of the aspects of palliative care services that may be offered in a urology practice, overview of current palliative care workforce, and the development of a health services and educational agenda that advances urologist- palliative care partnerships.","10203719; ","GORE, JOHN L.;","JALAL, HAMID","09/30/2021","09/29/2022","","Quality Improvement Summit on Opportunities to Improve Palliative Care in Urology","027765","ZHS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","29865",""
