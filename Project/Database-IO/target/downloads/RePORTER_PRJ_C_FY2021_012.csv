Atherosclerosis is a leading medical condition, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality as the result of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and stroke. Understanding the function of Drebrin in vascular smooth muscle and the mechanisms by which it inhibits atherosclerosis has the potential to lead to the identification of new therapeutic interventions to treat this important disorder.

In turn, this could yield long-term benefits for the VA by increasing evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP; i.e., prolonged exposure [PE] therapy and/or cognitive processing therapy [CPT]) initiation and enrollment.","12027807; ","RAINES, AMANDA MEDLEY;","","10/01/2020","09/30/2024","Address; Anxiety; Award; base; Behavioral; career; career development; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; Cognitive Therapy; comparative efficacy; Coupled; Data; design; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; Enrollment; Ensure; Etiology; evidence base; experience; Exposure to; Feedback; Focus Groups; follow-up; Fright; Funding; Goals; Grant; improved; Individual; Instruction; Intervention; Interview; Investigation; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Lead; Maintenance; Manuals; Mentorship; Methods; Military Personnel; Minority; Participant; Pathological anxiety; Patients; Persons; Play; post intervention; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; prevent; Psychotherapy; Qualitative Methods; Rain; Randomized Clinical Trials; recruit; Research; research and development; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Resistance; response; Role; Safety; Science; Scientist; Severities; skills; Stimulus; symptomatology; Symptoms; therapy design; Time; Training; Trauma; Treatment Protocols; trial comparing; Veterans; Waiting Lists; Writing; ","Examination of a Safety Aid Reduction Protocol for Treatment Resistant PTSD among Veterans","001978","ZRD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A2","01","","","",""

This proposal will investigate how the cargo within these extracellular vesicles gets taken up by recipient cells, which will have relevance to the neurodegenerative disease process, as well as to our ability to use extracellular vesicles to deliver medical treatments to the brain.","11329354; ","BLANCHETTE, CASSANDRA ;","MILLER, DANIEL L","12/01/2018","05/31/2021","Actins; Alzheimer's Disease; amphiphysin; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Area; Automobile Driving; base; Biological; Biological Models; Biology; Brain; Cell Communication; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell membrane; Cells; Communication; Complex; Cytoplasm; Disease; DNA; Drosophila genus; Electron Microscopy; Endocytosis; endosome membrane; Environment; Exhibits; exosome; experimental study; extracellular vesicles; Genetic; genetic risk factor; Goals; Health; Human; Image; Image Analysis; In Vitro; in vivo; Intracellular Transport; Knowledge; Label; Late Onset Alzheimer Disease; Leadership; Lighting; Lipids; Medical; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Mentorship; microscopic imaging; Microscopy; microvesicles; Modeling; Molecular; Multivesicular Body; Muscle; Muscle Cells; mutant; Mutation; nervous system disorder; Nervous system structure; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neuromuscular Junction; Neurons; novel; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Phagocytosis; Physiological; Play; postsynaptic; Postsynaptic Membrane; presynaptic; presynaptic neurons; Process; Proteins; quantitative imaging; Recycling; Regulation; Resolution; responsible research conduct; RNA; Role; Scientist; SH3 Domains; Signal Transduction; Structure; System; Testing; Tissues; tool; trafficking; Training; uptake; vesicle transport; vesicular release; ","Investigating the role of Amphiphysin  in extracellular vesicle cargo uptake in vivo","110123","NST","Neurological Sciences Training Initial Review Group ","","","03","34653","","34653",""

This research project has the potential to elucidate novel links between epigenetic regulators and core circadian rhythm proteins, both of which have been known to be linked to poor GBM prognosis, and establish small pharmacological clock molecules that have the ability to cross the blood- brain barrier as a new and more efficacious GBM therapy.","16260919; ","CHAN, PRISCILLA ;","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","12/01/2020","11/30/2023","Acetylation; Agonist; Angiogenic Factor; Apoptosis; Arginine; ARNT gene; ARNTL gene; Astrocytes; Attenuated; attenuation; Back; Binding; Biologic Characteristic; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Body Regions; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; cancer stem cell; Cell Cycle Arrest; cell growth; Cell Maintenance; Cells; ChIP-seq; circadian; circadian pacemaker; Circadian Rhythms; Citric Acid Cycle; Clock protein; Collaborations; Combined Modality Therapy; cryptochrome 1; Cues; Dependence; Development; DNA; E-Box Elements; efficacy testing; Employment; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Excision; experimental study; Exposure to; extracellular; Feedback; Foundations; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic; genetic corepressor; Genetic Transcription; Glioblastoma; Glutamates; Glycolysis; Growth; Heterogeneity; histone modification; Histones; Homeostasis; Hormone secretion; Hour; Hypothalamic structure; Immune; Immunoprecipitation; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Invaded; knock-down; Laboratories; Link; Lysine; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; melanopsin; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microglia; Mitochondria; Modeling; Modification; Mus; Muscle; Neuroglia; Neurons; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Nuclear Receptors; Oncogenic; Operative Surgical Procedures; outcome forecast; Output; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Patients; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Photosensitivity; Physiological; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Primary Neoplasm; Process; promoter; protein arginine methyltransferase 2; Proteins; Publishing; Quality of life; Radiation therapy; recruit; Research Project Grants; Resistance; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Role; self-renewal; Signal Transduction; Sleep; small molecule; stem cell proliferation; stem cells; stemness; suprachiasmatic nucleus; Survival Rate; Synaptic plasticity; synergism; targeted treatment; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; Transferase; Translations; tumor; Tumor Burden; tumor microenvironment; tumorigenic; Ubiquitination; Xenograft procedure; ","Implications of Circadian Clock Control on Glioblastoma","120654","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","45520","","45520",""

Women have up to twice the risk of PTSD as men (7). Compelling research on sleep and PTSD indicates that abnormal sleep plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of the disorder (8-10). Increasing evidence also indicates that sleep may impact memory for emotionally upsetting material (6, 11), and that women may have better memory for upsetting material than men (12-14), findings of major relevance to PTSD. Unfortunately, our understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD-related sleep disturbance is derived from studies of male, or predominantly male, samples (15). This creates profound barriers to understanding PTSD in women (12, 16-18). Increasing numbers of women are serving in the military, and are exposed to combat and potentially traumatic life events (19). Enhancing our understanding of sex differences in PTSD-related sleep disturbance is vital to developing treatments that adequately address the needs of both men and women veterans.","10440464; ","RICHARDS, ANNE ;","","01/01/2015","07/31/2020","Accounting; Address; Admission activity; Affective; Age; Area; Arousal; base; Behavior; Clinical; combat; Crossover Design; deprivation; Development; Disease; disorder risk; Distress; Emotional; emotional stimulus; Enrollment; Ensure; Equipment; Event; Event-Related Potentials; experience; Exposure to; Female; Functional disorder; gender difference; Health; health care service utilization; high risk; Image; imaging system; Individual; insight; International; Laboratories; Life; Light; male; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; Memory; memory consolidation; memory process; men; Mentors; Mentorship; Military Personnel; Modernization; Negative Valence; Neurobiology; neuromechanism; Nightmare; Participant; Pathologic; Play; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; programs; proliferative phase Menstrual cycle; Protocols documentation; Psychiatrist; Psychiatry; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; rapid eye movement; Reaction; REM Sleep; REM Sleep Deprivations; Reporting; Research; research study; Research Training; Residencies; Resources; response; Risk; Role; Sampling; San Francisco; sex; Sex Differences; sexual dimorphism; Sleep; sleep abnormalities; Sleep disturbances; sleep physiology; Solid; Stimulus; Stress; Symptoms; System; Testing; Training; trauma exposure; Universities; Veterans; Woman; ","A Study of Sexual Dimorphism in PTSD-Related Sleep Disturbance: A Focus on REM","000871","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","06","","","",""

The number of women receiving care at the VA has doubled since 2000, and although the total veteran population continues to decrease, the female veteran population has been increasing each year and this trend is expected to continue through 2044 (Office of the Actuary, Veteran Population Projections Model (VetPop2014)). Current treatments for lupus are often ineffective and have substantial short- and long-term toxicity. This project is relevant to veteran health because it will characterize the mechanism by which a disease-associated genetic variant reduces risk of lupus. Since this variant is associated with phenotypic effects that influence immune tolerance, understanding its mechanisms has important therapeutic implications.","1858980; ","BOACKLE, SUSAN A.;","","10/01/2020","09/30/2024","1q32; Address; Affect; Antigens; ATAC-seq; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Autoimmune Diabetes; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Bone Marrow; Caring; case control; Cell physiology; Cells; Chimera organism; Chromosomes; Communities; Complement 3b; Complement 3d Receptors; Complement component C5; Complement Receptor; Data; demographics; Department of Defense; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; ds-DNA; Early treatment; Effector Cell; Environmental Risk Factor; Exposure to; Female; FRAP1 gene; Future; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genetic variant; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; Heart Diseases; Immune; Immune system; Immune Tolerance; Immunologics; immunoregulation; Immunosuppression; Impairment; Inbred NOD Mice; Incidence; Individual; infection risk; Inflammatory; Intervention; Introns; Kidney Failure; Ku70 protein; Ligation; Lupus; Macrophage-1 Antigen; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Membrane; Military Personnel; Minority; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; novel therapeutic intervention; Onset of illness; Organ; overexpression; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Phase; Phenotype; Population; Population Projection; post-traumatic stress; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; protective effect; Regulatory Element; Risk; Role; Severities; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Specificity; Stimulus; Symptoms; Syndrome; System; systemic autoimmune disease; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Testing; Therapeutic; Toxic effect; Transcript; transcription factor; trend; Variant; Veterans; Woman; young woman; ","Role of Complement Receptor 1 in the Modulation of B Cell Tolerance","002042","ZRD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","",""

The Oncogenomics Laboratory at Moores Cancer Center: Lead by Dr Harismendy, the Oncogenomics laboratory is located in the Moores Cancer center. Dr Harismendy has established his laboratory to be able to develop molecular assays, sequence in high throughput at the UCSD-IGM core facility and analyzed the results on a compute-cloud compliant with HIPAA regulation. The laboratory includes 1 senior research associate, 3 computational biology students and one programmer. It further contracts with systems and databases administrators located in the division of biomedical informatics or at the San Diego Super Computer Center. The IGM Genomics Center at UCSD: The UCSD IGM Genomics Center offers full services in high throughput sequencing as well as whole-genome genotyping and copy number variation analysis. The IGM Genomics Center offers assay design consultation, sequencing library preparation (DNA/RNA/smallRNA/targeted sequencing), single cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics), lllumina platform sequencing (MiSeq, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq 6000), and Illumina genotyping and methylation arrays. The UC Davis Center for Genomic Pathology Laboratory provides expert histology and pathology services on a recharge basis. We provide tissue processing/sectioning, routine and special tissue staining, immunohistochemistry, whole slide scanning, database hosting, help with quantitative image analysis and pathology consulting services. Proposed Work: For the budget period we will perform the following work a. PCAPP project management x Continue to organize PCAPP monthly calls: Until December 2020, these calls will be used to keep track on  progress. The goal will be to ensure that data is being generated and shared and to address any logistical  or technical question that may delay progress. In 2021, the focus of the calls will be slowly transitioning to  discuss standardized analysis and present preliminary analysis across teams and organs. x Continue to attend and collaborate with the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). In particular identify  immediate opportunities for collaboration and data sharing. x Complete the data sharing via JPL LabCAS and dbGaP. Data standardization, upload and registration is a  complex process and every member will need to be assisted to accomplish these goals. b. PCAPP data generation and analysis support x The UCSD IGM genomic center will be contracted to perfrom Exome library preparation and sequencing of  any supplemental DNA samples that need additional coverage or replication x The UCSD team will offer to assist PCAPP teams to analyze and QC their raw data. They will determine  whether the JPL cloud can be used to scale up this analysis and will provide forums and discussion board  for data generator and analyst to discuss the results and suggest novel iterations. x The UC Davis histology core facility will be contracted to perform high resolution scanning, cell counting  and analysis of the multiplex immuno-histochemistry data from the other PCAPP teams. c. Pan-PCAPP analysis, data enrichment and integration Unified data processing: The raw sequencing data (RNA and DNA) from all PCAPP teams will be re-processed at once to generate a uniform call of gene expression, mutations and copy number aberrations. Similarly, the multiplex IHC primary analysis results will be aggregated and processed at once to ensure that no team or organ specific technical differences occurs. The results of the Pan-PCAPP unified analysis will be made available in dbGaP through a new version of the data. Pan-expression analysis: Mitotic grade, immune-infiltration, presence of necrosis, or lesion morphology (papillary, cribriform, tubular, solid) may reveal commonalities across organs. Each component, or expression state, driving these differences will be annotated via gene set enrichment analysis to understand which biological signal and processes may be responsible Pan-mutational analysis: from a set of known driver genes in cancer we will build the oncomap of driver events (mutations or copy number gains and losses), annotate them for their known, likely or unknown pathogenic consequences and determine how their prevalence differs from the drivers identified in more advanced tumors. Pan-spatial immune analysis; across all PML and organs we will determine the relative number of each cell types in the stroma, defining hot, warm and cold immune states and determine their association with expression states or mutational status, after correcting for organ type. We will contract with Dr. Cambell (UCSF) to calculate the EcoScore for each PML, which will summarize a more context depend micro- environmental status, accounting for the clustering and distance between cells. We will determine whether the EcoScore is associated with specific histological features or epithelial expression states, independently of the overall immune-infiltration. Mutational burden and signature analysis: The mutational load (substitution and copy number) will be calculated for all PMLs and tested for association with expression state and histology features. Similarly for PML with sufficient number of mutations, we will determine the contribution of each of the COSMIC mutational signatures [4] to the mutational load and determine whether the presence of any signature is associated with expression state, histology features, or stromal-immune states. Stromal-Epithelial interactions: we will perform an unsupervised integration of the data to investigate stromal vs epithelial interaction. We will first select and abstract multiple epithelial features derived for RNA and DNA analysis above, such as proliferation, burden, presence of key mutational signature, organ-independent expression state (NMF cluster membership), common mutation drivers. We will then use random forest regression with 5 fold-cross validation to determine which features associate with specific stromal immune features derived from the mIHC experiments: hot / cold stroma, immuno-suppressive, proliferative T-cells, EcoScore, etc.","6985255 (contact); 6486040; 8748247; ","HWANG, EUN-SIL SHELLEY (contact); MALEY, CARLO ; WEST, ROBERT B;","GHOSH-JANJIGIAN, SHARMISTHA","12/08/2020","06/30/2023","Accounting; Address; Adjuvant; Administrator; Adoption; Archives; Atlases; Automobile Driving; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biomedical informatics; Breast; Budgets; Cancer Center; cancer genomics; cancer type; Cell Count; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cells; Clinical; clinically significant; Cloud Computing; Collaborations; Collection; Communities; Complex; Computational Biology; computer center; computerized data processing; Consult; Consultations; Contracts; Copy Number Polymorphism; Core Facility; Data; Data Analyses; data integration; data sharing; data standards; database of Genotypes and Phenotypes; Databases; design; Detection; Development; DNA; DNA analysis; DNA Sequence Alteration; driver mutation; Ensure; Epithelial; Epithelial-Stromal Communication; Epithelium; Event; exome; experimental study; follow-up; Formalin; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; Guidelines; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Heterogeneity; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Histologic; Histology; Human; Image Analysis; Immune; Immunohistochemistry; innovation; Intervention; Invasive Lesion; Laboratories; Lead; Lesion; Lesion by Morphology; Libraries; Life; Logistics; Lung; Malignant Neoplasms; member; Methods; Methylation; Mitotic; Modeling; Molecular; multimodality; Mutation; Mutation Analysis; mutational status; Necrosis; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; overtreatment; Pancreas; Papillary; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Patient observation; Pilot Projects; Postdoctoral Fellow; precision medicine; premalignant; Preparation; Prevalence; prevent; Process; Prostate; quantitative imaging; random forest; Regulation; Resolution; Resources; Risk; RNA; RNA analysis; Sampling; Savings; scale up; Scanning; screening; Screening for cancer; sequencing platform; Services; Signal Transduction; single-cell RNA sequencing; Slide; Solid; Specific qualifier value; Standardization; Students; System; T-Cell Proliferation; targeted sequencing; Testing; tissue processing; Tissue Stains; transcriptome; translational study; Tubular formation; tumor; Tumor-infiltrating immune cells; Validation; whole genome; Work; ","Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project","233254","","","","S1","01","289300","15250","304550",""

Being able to appropriately modify our behavior relative to our own uncertainty regarding future rewards is crucial for survival. Malfunctions of behavior and emotion in uncertain contexts are associated with psychiatric disorders and maladaptive behavioral states, such as anxiety, persistent risk- seeking, and drug-addiction.

Sleep disruption in PTSD is very common and hyperarousal features of PTSD have a bidirectional relationship to sleep problems. Current treatment options have limited efficacy. Further, pharmacological treatments for poor sleep quality often deleteriously affect sleep architecture and may also be addictive. We will examine the efficacy of a non-invasive treatment option called transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) to improve sleep architecture (aim 1), hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD (aim 2), and predictors of individual differences in response (e.g., mild TBI features) (aim 3). tVNS is promising because the vagus nerve affects brain structures that underlie core hyperarousal PTSD symptoms. Preliminary data in animals and humans suggest efficacy in reducing hyperarousal symptoms and increasing restorative sleep quality.

This limits the use of pupillometry in studies of state dependent neural computation and behavior in the healthy brain, and in inferring pathological dynamics of neuromodulatory processes in the diseased brain. We will examine the extent to which the locus coeruleus (LC), a noradrenergic brainstem nucleus, mediates the correlation between pupil size and arousal in cognitive tasks.

Between 2013-2017 multiple clinical trials of newer agents (SGLT2 or GLP1RA) were conducted versus placebo that demonstrated cardiovascular or renal benefit with a pronounced effect among those with pre-existing CVD. There is less data available among those without CVD. Evidence on the advantages and risks of these newer agents relative to other commonly used medications remains unknown because data from real world cohorts is methodologically limited for many reasons. We propose to conduct a large longitudinal national study using administrative, clinical and laboratory data to quantify the relative risks and benefits of newer antidiabetic agents among Veterans. We will include cardiovascular and renal outcomes and risks of amputations and fractures in 2 distinct cohorts, those with and without CVD.

A related gap in knowledge is whether AT differences in MHO and MUO are also seen in the AT of healthy and unhealthy lean individuals, and in individuals prior to weight gain. We have documented the first spontaneous monkey model of MHO and unhealthy (MUO) obesity and will study visceral and subcutaneous AT cellular structure and mitochondrial function in lean and obese monkeys that differ by health status while cardiometabolic health is concurrently characterized.

We will test the hypothesis that heart cells directly sense the increased level of fat and upregulate a novel mechanism that causes inflammation and functional impairment of the heart by facilitating the interaction of two molecules in the nucleus.

A critical period is a developmental epoch during which the nervous system is expressly sensitive to specific stimuli that are required for experience dependent learning, circuit organization, and synaptic plasticity. Critical periods have been described for both sensory (e.g. vision, touch) and social (e.g. language, imprinting) functions. While mechanistic insights into the establishment and reinstatement of sensory critical periods have transformed therapeutic practice (e.g. for treating deafness and blindness), to date, the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms underlying social critical periods are largely unknown. Our proposed studies will have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social impairments, such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as diseases like addiction and PTSD that respond to social influence or are aggravated by social injury. At the same time, these insights will provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies, improved mechanistic understanding of therapeutic interventions currently in clinical trials, and objective measures of social reward learning across maturation that are tractable for future translational studies.","7080942; ","DLEN, GL  ;","GRIFFIN, JAMES","12/06/2019","11/30/2024","Ablation; Achievement; Acute; addiction; Address; Adult; Anatomy; Animals; Area; Argipressin; argipressin receptor; autism spectrum disorder; Axon; base; Bathing; Behavioral; Blindness; Brain; Brain region; Clinical Trials; conditioned place preference; critical period; Data; deafness; design; Development; Disease; experience; FLP recombinase; Frequencies; functional genomics; Future; Globus Pallidus; Goals; Human; Hypothalamic structure; Impairment; imprint; improved; in vivo; Injury; insight; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Language; Learning; Long-Term Depression; magnocellular; Maps; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Molecular; Mus; Nature; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurons; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Nucleus Accumbens; optogenetics; Oxytocin; paraventricular nucleus; parvocellular; patch clamp; Pathogenesis; Physiologic pulse; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; postnatal; postsynaptic; premature; presynaptic; receptor; Regulation; Rewards; Role; Schizophrenia; Sensory; Signal Transduction; Slice; social; Social Behavior; Social Conditions; Social Environment; Social Interaction; Source; Stimulus; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic plasticity; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; tool; Touch sensation; translational neuroscience; translational study; Up-Regulation; V1a vasopressin receptor; Vasopressins; viral gene delivery; Vision; ","Dissecting the role of vasopressin in regulating the critical period for social reward learning","098184","NMB","Neurobiology of Motivated Behavior Study Section ","","","02","193500","123356","316856",""
