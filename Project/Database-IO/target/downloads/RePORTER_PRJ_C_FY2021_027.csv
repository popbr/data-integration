Our recent phase I, first-in-human trial of CD38-targeted immunoPET with 89Zr-DFO- daratumumab successfully demonstrated sensitive imaging of myeloma beyond the abilities of current imaging modalities; this phase II trial would identify promising clinical applications of 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab immunoPET in patients with myeloma, including histologic proof of imaging findings. Successful imaging would be transformative for the detection of myeloma, monitoring response to therapy, and future design of novel radioimmunotherapies for patients with myeloma.","10270662; 10450224 (contact); ","LANDGREN, CARL OLA ; ULANER, GARY  (contact);","WANG, CHIAYENG","07/01/2020","01/31/2024","Antibodies; base; Biopsy; blind; Blood Tests; Bone marrow biopsy; burden of illness; cancer imaging; Cells; Clinical; clinical application; clinical care; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Combined Modality Therapy; design; Detection; Detection of Minimal Residual Disease; Disease; dosimetry; early phase trial; experience; first-in-human; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography; Funding Opportunities; Future; Goals; Histologic; Human; human imaging; Image; imaging agent; imaging modality; Immunoglobulins; ImmunoPET; individual patient; innovation; Investigation; Laboratories; Measurement; Measures; Membrane Proteins; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Methods; Monitor; Monoclonal Antibodies; Multiple Myeloma; multiple myeloma M Protein; novel; outcome forecast; Patient Care; Patient imaging; Patient Monitoring; Patients; PET/CT scan; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; phase I trial; Phase II Clinical Trials; phase II trial; Plasma Cell Neoplasm; Plasma Cells; Positron-Emission Tomography; preclinical imaging; predicting response; Prognostic Marker; Proteins; Radiochemistry; Radioimmunotherapy; Radiolabeled; Research Personnel; Residual Tumors; response; Safety; Selection for Treatments; Serum; Site; Surface; targeted imaging; theranostics; Therapeutic Agents; Tracer; Translations; treatment response; tumor; Tumor Burden; United States; uptake; virtual; Visualization; Work; ","CD38-TARGETED IMMUNOPET OF MYELOMA: PHASE 2 TRIAL OF CLINICAL APPLICATIONS","248398","IGIS","Imaging Guided Interventions and Surgery Study Section ","","","02","414999","183927","598926",""

These clots are the second leading cause of death in cancer but the mechanisms by which they form are not well understood, which makes identifying patients at high risk of developing these clots challenging. In this study, we explore the role of enzymes that regulate clot formation in cancer induced clotting and examine the effect of a novel class of therapeutics on cancer associated clot formation.

This is done by determining if cells obtained from individuals carrying known risk alleles are more sensitive to cisplatin toxicity, to what extent cisplatin toxicity is heritable and whether there are additional genetic loci that are predictive of cisplatin toxicity and therefore associated with CAHL. To accomplish this, we plan to employ our recently published method (Chan et. al., Genome Medicine, 2018) that enables the multiplex testing of cells from many different donors by pooling them together so that we can assay cells from many different donors, yet be able to obtain individual level phenotype data for each donor.","12449185; ","CHAN, YING LEONG ;","WATSON, BRACIE","08/01/2019","07/31/2022","","Harnessing Otic Progenitor Cells Derived From Many Donors to Test for Cisplatin Associated Hearing Loss","018092","CDRC","Communication Disorders Review Committee ","","","03","97047","65507","162554",""

We fall short of understanding how Notch molecules choose the targets they do. Previously, we explored this from the perspective of amino acid composition in the Notch intracellular domains (the ?business end? of the protein). We ruled out composition as a factor differentiating two related proteins with different clinical footprints, Notch1 and Notch2. Our data indicates that much of Notch activity reflects strength (defined here as the ultimate number of intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) molecules reaching the nucleus, integrating ligand-mediated release and nuclear translocation), and duration (half life of NICD/RBPjk/MAML/DNA complexes, integrating cooperativity and stability). We discovered recently that another protein, Runx1, is a frequent binder near Notch bound sites, and Runx1 is needed to regulate half of the cellular transcripts Notch activates. Based on these, and additional findings, we propose to address the following unanswered questions: (1) What is the biochemical basis for Runx1/NICD collaboration? (2) What genomic features distinguish sites Notch- RBP bind to from other RBPj sites? (3) What is the mechanism NICD utilizes to increase target gene expression frequency?","1883000 (contact); 11522271; ","KOPAN, RAPHAEL  (contact); WEIRAUCH, MATTHEW TYSON;","XU, JIANHUA","08/01/1996","01/31/2022","activating transcription factor; Address; Adenine; Adult; Affect; Affinity; Amino Acids; Antibodies; base; Binding; Biochemical; blind; Businesses; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cells; Chimera organism; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Chromosomes; Clinical; cohesin; cohesion; Collaborations; combinatorial; Complement; Complex; Computer Analysis; computerized tools; Coupled; Data; Data Set; Disease; Distant; DNA; DNA Binding; DNA Sequence; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase; Effectiveness; Elements; Enhancers; Epigenetic Process; Escherichia coli; Event; experimental study; falls; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Guide RNA; Half-Life; Histones; Human; In Vitro; Investigation; Ligands; Maintenance; Mediating; member; Methodology; Methods; Methylation; Methyltransferase; Modeling; Monitor; Morphologic artifacts; Mus; notch protein; novel; Nuclear; Nuclear Translocation; Nucleosomes; Null Lymphocytes; predictive test; preference; Proteins; Proteolysis; Regulatory Element; Resolution; Resources; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Specificity; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Time; tool; Transcript; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; virtual; Vision; ","Biochemical and Computational Analysis of Notch signal transduction","055479","CSRS","Cellular Signaling and Regulatory Systems Study Section ","","","22","294944","174017","468961",""

It is the fifth most common cause of pediatric hospitalization and, cumulatively, the most costly among infants and children. Currently there is no single test available that can distinguish between the >10 pathogens that cause CAP. The objective of this prospective cohort study is to determine distinct metabolite profile for major classes of pathogens that cause CAP in children (e.g. virus, typical and atypical bacteria). Urine and blood samples will be collected from children diagnosed with CAP in the Emergency Department or who are hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Urine from children whose PCR tests are positive for a virus, typical bacteria or atypical bacteria will be sex and aged-matched to control samples. All urine samples will then be evaluated using quantitative 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. Advanced statistical methods will be applied to the identified metabolite dataset to determine unique metabolite profiles. These profiles will be used as the foundation for future studies in the diagnostic capabilities of 1H-NMR for pathogen identification in children diagnosed with CAP. In addition, the concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to diagnostic testing for multiple infectious diseases.","10107031; ","AMBROGGIO, LILLIAM ;","LU, KRISTINA","03/07/2017","02/28/2022","11 year old; Accident and Emergency department; accurate diagnosis; Active Learning; Address; Adult; Advanced Development; adverse drug reaction; Age; aged; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; Appointment; Award; Bacteria; bacterial community; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Pneumonia; biobank; Biological; Biometry; Blood; Blood specimen; career; career development; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical database; clinical decision-making; clinical examination; Clinical Management; clinical phenotype; clinical practice; Clostridium difficile; co-infection; cohort; Colitis; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communities; cost; Culture Techniques; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic accuracy; Diagnostic tests; Disease Management; Doctor of Pharmacy; Doctor of Philosophy; Education; Educational workshop; Emergency Medicine; Enrollment; Ensure; Environment; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Etiology; Evaluation; Faculty; Fellowship; Foundations; Funding; Future; Goals; Grant; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; improved; improved outcome; Infant; Infection; Infectious Disease Epidemiology; innovation; inpatient service; Institution; Joints; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Leadership; Learning; Lung; Medical center; Medicine; meetings; member; Mentors; metabolic profile; metabolome; metabolomics; metabolomics resource; Methodology; Methods; Michigan; microbial; Molecular and Cellular Biology; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multicenter Studies; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Nasopharynx; noninvasive diagnosis; novel; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; overtreatment; pathogen; Pathogen detection; pathogenic bacteria; pathogenic virus; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Pediatric Hospitals; Pediatrics; phenotypic data; Pneumonia; point-of-care diagnostics; Population; Postdoctoral Fellow; professor; Prospective cohort study; Public Health; Research; Research Activity; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Resources; response; Risk; Sampling; Science; sex; skills; small molecule; Smoking; Source; Specimen; Sputum; Statistical Data Interpretation; Statistical Methods; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Structure; success; Systems Biology; Techniques; Testing; Thoracic Radiography; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Translating; Universities; Urine; validation studies; Variant; Viral; Viral Pneumonia; Virus; Work; ","Metabolomics Evaluation of the Etiology of Pneumonia","125413","MID","Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee ","","","06","118750","9500","128250",""

While the LEAP study demonstrated that peanut allergy could be prevented in about 80% of high risk infants by early peanut introduction, it is important to recognize that early peanut introduction is not universally successful in the prevention of peanut allergy. In this project, we will have the opportunity to characterize infants with and without peanut allergy from both a clinical and mechanistic standpoint, and then study the safety and efficacy of peanut oral immunotherapy in this cohort, which to our knowledge will be the earliest initiation of any form of specific immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy.","6785863; ","WOOD, ROBERT A;","DONG, GANG","03/03/2017","02/29/2024","Adolescence; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Age; Allergic; Allergy to peanuts; base; Biological Markers; Birth; Charge; Child; Childhood; Clinical; clinical center; clinical investigation; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; cohort; Collaborations; Communication; Databases; desensitization; Development; Double-Blind Method; early onset; Early treatment; effective therapy; Enrollment; epigenomics; experience; Food; Food Hypersensitivity; Funding; Funding Opportunities; Future; Goals; Health; high risk; high risk infant; Hypersensitivity; Immunologic Factors; Immunologics; Immunology; Immunotherapy; immunotherapy trials; Impairment; Incidence; Infant; innovation; Intervention Trial; investigator-initiated trial; Laboratory Personnel; Laboratory Technicians; Lead; Leadership; Life; Malnutrition; meetings; member; metabolomics; microbiome research; Mission; Morbidity - disease rate; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; Natural History; next generation; novel strategies; Nursing Research; Oral; oral immunotherapy; Participant; patient oriented; patient population; Patients; peer; Performance; performance site; Phenotype; Physicians; placebo controlled study; Population; Population Study; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Quality of life; Reaction; recruit; Research; Research Assistant; Research Personnel; research study; safety study; Sampling; Schedule; Scientist; Site; skin prick test; Team Nursing; Teleconferences; Telephone; Time; Training; Universities; Wood material; ","Clinical Research Unit: Johns Hopkins University","130838","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","143512","91488","235000",""

This is particularly problematic in breast cancer where over 25% of the ~150,000 patients undergoing lumpectomy annually have MRD, doubling LR and decreasing survival, necessitating a re-excision. However, current intraoperative imagers are too bulky to visualize labeled tumor cells in small surgical cavities and we leverage advances in upconverting nanoparticles and integrated circuits to introduce a novel ultra-thin planar fluorescent imaging ?skin? that eliminates optics, capable of coating surgical instrumentation, transforming the tools themselves into microscopic imagers.","12633120; ","ANWAR, MEKHAIL ;","ATANASIJEVIC, TATJANA","03/01/2019","01/31/2022","absorption; Address; Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Alloys; Antibodies; Area; base; Beds; Biodistribution; Biological Models; biomaterial compatibility; breast lumpectomy; cancer cell; cancer imaging; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer subtypes; cancer surgery; Cells; Cessation of life; Color; Complex; Consequentialism; Coupled; Custom; Data; density; design; Diagnosis; Disease; draining lymph node; Electronics; Ensure; ERBB2 gene; ex vivo imaging; Excision; fluorescence imaging; fluorophore; Generations; Hand; Human; Image; Image-Guided Surgery; imager; imaging agent; imaging platform; improved; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Injections; insight; instrumentation; irradiation; Kinetics; Knowledge; Label; Left; lens; Lighting; Location; lymph nodes; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Microscopic; microscopic imaging; millimeter; minimally invasive; Modernization; Molecular; molecular imaging; Molecular Target; mouse model; nanoparticle; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; novel; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; optical imaging; Optics; Patients; Performance; Photons; Postoperative Period; Problem Solving; Procedures; Property; Radiation therapy; Reagent; Recurrence; Residual Tumors; Resolution; Risk; Sampling; Sampling Errors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sentinel Lymph Node; Signal Transduction; Silicon; Skin; Speed; Surface; Surgeon; Surgical Instruments; Surgically-Created Resection Cavity; Thinness; Time; Tissue imaging; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; Trastuzumab; tumor; two-photon; Vision; Visualization; Woman; ","An Ultra-Thin Molecular Imaging Skin for Intraoperative Imaging of Microscopic Residual Disease in Cancer","027238","BMIT","Biomedical Imaging Technology Study Section ","","","03","150000","83690","233690",""

A better understanding of visual processing for darks and lights has important implications for basic brain research as well as potential clinical applications. Some of the most widely-used visual tests have been designed more than 100 years ago and remained unchanged since then (e.g. dark characters on light background to measure visual acuity, light spots on dark background to measure visual fields). It is not entirely clear why these tests were designed in such a way but it is very likely that the first eye charts used dark characters because they were printed on paper and the first measurements of visual fields used light spots because they required projecting lights on different locations of a screen. The work in this proposal aims to provide scientific bases for current visual tests and help to adapt these tests to specific diseases using our increased knowledge of how they affect the function of ON and OFF pathways.","1858431; ","ALONSO, JOSE-MANUEL ;","FLANDERS, MARTHA C","03/01/2017","02/28/2022","Affect; Amblyopia; Animals; area striata; Automobile Driving; awake; base; Brain; brain research; Cells; Chronic; clinical application; Complex; design; Dimensions; Disease; Equilibrium; Eye; Felis catus; fly; Frequencies; Goals; Human; Image; innovation; Knowledge; lens; Light; Location; luminance; Mammals; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Methods; multi-electrode arrays; Myopia; Neurons; Neurosciences; novel; Output; Paper; Pathway interactions; Perception; Phase; Primates; Process; Property; Psychophysics; receptive field; Research; response; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Spottings; Stimulus; Structure; temporal measurement; Testing; Textbooks; Thalamic structure; Time; V1 neuron; Vision; Visual; Visual Acuity; Visual Cortex; Visual Fields; visual information; Visual Perception; visual processing; Visual system structure; Work; ","Neuronal mechanisms of cortical processing in early vision","027361","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","242500","150350","392850",""

Also, the majority of novel human pathogens that have emerged in recent decades have been shown to originate from animal hosts, including HIV, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and the influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1. Vector-borne infections transmitted from wildlife reservoir species to humans are thus of major concern. A need exists for the active surveillance for potential pathogens in order to predict and combat emerging tick-borne diseases. This project will identify both novel pathogens and pathogens that are expanding their range into the Mnisi area, and in so doing will characterize the pathogens to determine the most appropriate test to use for detection. !","14098535; ","OOSTHUIZEN, MARINDA CATHARINA;","PERDUE, SAMUEL S","03/18/2019","02/29/2024","Acute; Address; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African; Anaplasma phagocytophilum; Anaplasmosis; Animals; Area; Arthropod Vectors; Bacterial Infections; Bartonella; base; Borrelia; burden of illness; Canis familiaris; Caring; Cattle; Clinic; Clinical; combat; Communicable Diseases; Communities; community clinic; Community Health; community living; Control Groups; Country; Coxiella; Coxiella burnetii; Detection; Development; Diagnostic tests; Disease; Disease Management; Domestic Animals; Ebola virus; Ecology; Ensure; Environment; Epidemiology; Etiology; Evaluation; Exposure to; Faculty; Fever; fighting; Genetic Variation; global health; Goals; graduate student; Grant; granulocyte; Health; health economics; healthy volunteer; High Prevalence; HIV; Home environment; Human; human pathogen; improved; Incidence; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; influenzavirus; Infrastructure; innovation; Interdisciplinary Study; Intervention; Investigation; knowledge base; Laboratories; Leptospira; Livestock; Malaria; Medical; Mentors; Metagenomics; microbiome; microbiome analysis; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; novel; Order Spirochaetales; Organism; Parasitic Diseases; pathogen; Patients; Personal Satisfaction; Pilot Projects; Populations at Risk; Postdoctoral Fellow; Process; Province; Public Health; public health relevance; Q Fever; Reporting; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resources; response; Rickettsia; Rift Valley fever virus; Rodent; Rural; rural area; Rural Community; rural poverty; rural South Africa; Sampling; SARS coronavirus; Sepsis; Site; South Africa; spotted fever; Technology; Testing; tick bite; tick-borne; Tick-Borne Diseases; tick-borne pathogen; Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever; Ticks; tool; Training; urban area; vector control; vector tick; vector-borne; vector-borne infection; vector-borne pathogen; Vector-transmitted infectious disease; virome; Virus Diseases; West Nile virus; Wild Animals; World Health Organization; Zoonoses; ","Zoonotic tick-borne pathogens contribute to acute febrile illness in rural South Africa","136832","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","136114","4280","140394",""

The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress. We propose to develop a lab-on-a-chip platform technology, Multifunctional Exosome Sorter (MFES), that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers integrating; (i) a vessel-on-a-chip module, (ii) a high-yield exosome size-based isolation module, (iii) a magnetic bead-based surface biomarker sorting chamber, and (iv) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology, where such a technological innovation will uniquely enable to study the biology of exosome subsets associated with flow dynamics in PAH.","8102875; 8631559 (contact); ","DE JESUS PEREZ, VINICIO A; DEMIRCI, UTKAN  (contact);","XIAO, LEI","03/25/2021","02/28/2023","Acoustics; Address; angiogenesis; Animal Model; Antibodies; base; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Markers; Biology; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular system; CD81 gene; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Culture Media; Cultured Cells; cytokine; Data Set; design; Disease; Endothelial Cells; endothelial dysfunction; Endothelium; Etiology; exosome; Experimental Models; Exposure to; extracellular vesicles; Genetic; Goals; Heart failure; hemodynamics; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Lab-On-A-Chips; Life; Lung; Machine Learning; machine learning algorithm; magnetic beads; Mediating; Methods; Microfluidics; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; monolayer; multiple omics; new technology; novel; novel therapeutics; Nucleic Acids; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathologic Processes; Pattern; Phase; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Population; pressure; Process; Production; protein metabolite; Proteomics; pulmonary arterial hypertension; Reporting; Reproducibility; Resolution; response; Role; Seeds; shear stress; Signal Transduction; Sorting - Cell Movement; Stress; stressor; Surface; Techniques; technological innovation; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Time; tool; transcriptome sequencing; Vascular remodeling; Vision; ","A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH.","156761","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","86363","236363",""

The recent approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer have represented a major step forward, however little is understood as to (1) how adaptive immune resistance occurs within the tumor, (2), why only a small subset of patients respond to anti-PD-1 and (3) what are the T cells targeting at a genetic level. The leading hypothesis is that the mutation landscape is important with data now emerging from our group and others, demonstrating the mutation load is important in immune checkpoint blockade response however this needs to be studied more exhaustively. This proposal will apply new technologies to the study of response and resistance to immunotherapies in the context of a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in patient-oriented research and immune monitoring, comprehensive genetics and informatics analysis of the tumor microenvironment with state of the art validation in vitro and mouse modeling.

Project Narrative Solid organ transplantation has become an effective therapeutic option for children with end stage organ disease. However, the immunosuppression required for prevention of immune-mediated rejection of the graft also places children at increased risk of infection and malignancy. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a common virus in the human population that is linked to serious complications, including cancer, in pediatric transplant recipients. Effective diagnosis and medical management of EBV-related disease is hampered by our lack of understanding of the immune mechanisms that determine the outcome of EBV infection. In this proposal we will use cutting edge approaches to characterize on a single cell level, the immune response to EBV in children whose immune system is controlling the virus compared to those that are not.

We have suggested that cells use an inactive form of TGF? as a sensor of mechanical changes in the environment. When there are certain alterations in the blood vessel wall such as increased blood pressure or synthesis of abnormal components, TGF? is mobilized to fix the structure because TGF? controls the production of new vessel wall molecules. To understand how TGF? functions, we will identify the specific individual components of the latent TGF? complex. We will also discern whether the supporting structure in the diseased aorta releases active TGF? more readily than does the normal supporting structure when placed under mechanical stress. The information obtained from these experiments will provide an understanding of how latent TGF? contributes to TAA and thereby illustrate potential points for the development of drug therapy. !","1863986; ","RIFKIN, DANIEL B;","MCDONALD, CHERYL","03/01/2018","02/28/2023","Address; Affect; Aneurysm; Animals; Aorta; Aortic Diseases; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biogenesis; biomechanical model; Biomechanics; Birth; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Cell Communication; Cells; Characteristics; Chest; Complement; Complement Factor B; Complex; Defect; Development; Dissection; drug development; Environment; Event; experimental study; Extracellular Matrix; Failure; Futile Cycling; Gene Expression Profile; Genetic; genetic approach; Genotype; Glean; Hypertension; In Vitro; Individual; Infusion procedures; insight; Knowledge; Lesion; Marfan Syndrome; Measurement; mechanical load; Mechanical Stress; Mechanics; mechanotransduction; Medial; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; novel; Participant; Pharmacotherapy; preservation; pressure; prevent; Production; Property; protective effect; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; receptor; response; Response Latencies; sensor; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Stress; Stretching; Structure; therapeutic target; Thoracic aorta; Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factors; Vascular remodeling; ","Altered Mechanotransduction","134605","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5211","","04","402996","35113","","438109"

Our studies demonstrate that Zbtb44, a member of ThPOK family of transcription factors forms a complex with the T-box transcription factor, Eomes which is critically essential for effector function of CD8+ T cells. In the ?exhausted? CD8+T cells, Trim47 degrades Zbtb44 and disrupts the Zbtb44-Eomes complex resulting in the inhibitory transcriptional profile. We aim to prevent CAR-T exhaustion by blocking the Zbtb44- Trim47 pathway.

Dr. Park is investigating a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer by creating a hostile microenvironment for immune cells. Tumor cells secrete mediators to transform immune cells to help tumor cells grow. As a result, the transformed immune cells aid tumor growth as opposed to stopping the expansion. Through this project, Dr. Park will examine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of how the tumor cell-secreted mediator increases the number of tumor-favoring immune cells. Furthermore, he will develop new approaches to intervening the tumor-favoring immune cells to get therapeutic benefits for lung cancer treatment.","10175521; ","PARK, GYE YOUNG ;","","01/01/2020","12/31/2024","Adopted; Anabolism; anti-cancer; arm; Attenuated; base; Basic Science; Binding; Biochemical; Biopsy; Body Fluids; Cancer Biology; Cancer Etiology; cancer immunotherapy; Cancer Model; cancer therapy; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; chemokine; Chemotaxis; Clinical; clinical material; Clinical Trials; conditional knockout; CSF1 gene; cytokine; Cytometry; Data; Dendritic Cells; Development; Encapsulated; exoenzyme; extracellular; Genes; genetic analysis; Human; Immune; immune function; Immune system; immunogenic; Immunologics; Immunologist; Inhalation; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Knockout Mice; Lead; Lung; Lung Adenocarcinoma; lysophosphatidic acid; Lysophospholipase; macrophage; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; migration; mortality; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Mutation; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cells; Nano delivery; neoplastic cell; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Oncologist; Outcome; paracrine; Pathway interactions; Patient Recruitments; Patients; Phenotype; Phospholipids; Play; Population; Progression-Free Survivals; Prospective Studies; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Cell; Receptor Gene; Receptor Inhibition; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Role; Sampling; Stimulus; System; Tamoxifen; targeted agent; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Mice; treatment strategy; tumor; Tumor Biology; Tumor Cell Biology; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor progression; tumor-immune system interactions; Tumor-infiltrating immune cells; Ultrasonography; ","CSF1 Receptor-Mediated Tumor Microenvironment in Lung Cancer","004981","ZRD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","",""

Clinicians lack the ability to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information to the family so that they can come to the best decision for the infant, as current prediction models rely on older data, are not tailored to the individual institution where the birth is occurring, and use limited information to make predictions; furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge in the following: how the use of prediction tools might impact counseling and clinical practice; whether tools can make any difference in outcomes such as survival without morbidity and length of stay before death; and the cost impact and cost-effectiveness of using such tools.  We propose to expand the knowledge base on prediction models for periviable gestation in an existing network of neonatal intensive care units in California ? involving 140 hospitals from which to obtain data?by implementing the prediction model with established collaborative quality improvement methods, evaluating the impact of implementation on practices and outcomes, and examining the cost impact of implementation in clinical practice.","9254520; ","LEE, HENRY CHONG;","LONGO, MONICA","03/01/2020","02/28/2025","2 year old; Address; anxious; base; Behavior; Birth; California; care outcomes; Caring; Cessation of life; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; clinical decision-making; clinical practice; cohort; collaborative care; Communities; cost; cost effectiveness; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; cost estimate; Counseling; Data; Data Aggregation; Data Collection; data infrastructure; Decision Making; Delivery Rooms; demographics; disability; electronic data; falls; Family; fetal; fetal diagnosis; follow-up; Gestational Age; Hospitals; improved; improved outcome; Individual; Infant; Infant Care; innovation; Institution; Knowledge; knowledge base; Lead; Length of Stay; Life; Link; Methods; Modeling; Modernization; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mothers; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Neonatal; Neonatal Intensive Care Units; neonate; Network-based; Neurodevelopmental Disability; Neurodevelopmental Impairment; Neurologic; Outcome; outcome forecast; Outcome Study; Palliative Care; Patients; Performance; Perinatal; periviable; Population; population based; predict clinical outcome; predictive modeling; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; prognostic; Quality of Care; Randomized; Research; Resources; respiratory; Resuscitation; Risk; risk prediction model; Source; Survivors; Testing; Time; tool; Trauma; Uncertainty; Use Effectiveness; Variant; ","Improving outcomes of periviable births via an enhanced prediction tool","098287","HSOD","Health Services Organization and Delivery Study Section ","","","02","221602","112254","333856",""

Military service significantly increases the odds of chronic LBP relative to non-military personnel. Back pain during mili- tary service is a strong predictor of debilitating LBP later in life with the highest risk of disabling LBP being five years after the initial injury. LBP is among the top leading conditions that bring about board reviews and life- time compensation for the Military. Treating chronic LBP remains a challenge among VA clinics with no uniform consensus as to the most effective means to do so. With the aging Veteran population, the incidence of LBP and the burden on the US economy will likely continue to increase. The proposed research is designed to test a promising new rehabilitation strategy which augments the regenerative potential of the native tissues respon- sible for LBP. The proposed work is highly significant because it will advance our therapeutic strategy toward translation to clinical trials.

Our previous studies identified a molecular adjuvant that uses CD40 and TLR agonists that induces protective long lived T cell populations in mice and primates but why this approach is so effective is unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that dendritic cell production of IL-27 activates metabolic changes in recently primed T cells that result in sustained cMyc activation required for this long-lived response. This project will will use intravital imaging of T? DC interactions and the manipulation of IL-27, DC functions and c-Myc pathways to understand the mechanistic determinants that determine the efficacy of combined CD40L/TLR adjuvant.

Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.","1872045; ","RIZZO, MATTHEW ;","PLUDE, DANA JEFFREY","09/01/1999","02/28/2025","Achievement; Activities of Daily Living; Address; Affect; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease risk; analytical method; analytical tool; Automobile Driving; base; Behavior; Biological; Biometry; Caring; Classification; Clinical; clinical predictors; Cognitive; cognitive neuroscience; Communities; Complement; Computer Vision Systems; cost; Data; Data Set; Dementia; Detection; Devices; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; digital; Disease; Disease Progression; driving behavior; Early Diagnosis; Early identification; Early treatment; Engineering; Environment; Fingerprint; Foundations; functional decline; functional disability; Goals; health care availability; High Performance Computing; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; innovation; Intervention; Light; Location; Machine Learning; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Medicine; meetings; mild cognitive impairment; Modeling; Monitor; normal aging; novel; older driver; older patient; Patients; Pattern; Persons; Phase; Play; pre-clinical; prevent; Quality of life; Recording of previous events; Records; Research Project Grants; Risk; Role; Rural; rural setting; Safety; Sampling; screening; sensor; sensor technology; Severities; Signal Transduction; Sleep; statistical and machine learning; success; supervised learning; Syndrome; System; Taxonomy; Techniques; Testing; Time; tool; Transportation; United States National Institutes of Health; urban setting; visual motor; wearable device; wearable sensor technology; Weather; ","Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer?s disease","017177","CP","Cognition and Perception Study Section ","","","16","774141","265537","1039678",""

This approach will add value to existing cardiac cine-CMR by also obtaining two quantitative measures including oxygen utility that we hypothesize would correlate with the presence of myocardial infarction.","12100190; ","KAWAJI, KEIGO ;","WANG, WAYNE C","02/01/2019","01/31/2024","Acute; Affect; American Heart Association; Anatomy; Angiography; Architecture; base; Biomechanics; Biomedical Engineering; Brain; Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; career; career development; Catheters; Cause of Death; Cessation of life; Chicago; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Sciences; clinically significant; cohort; Contrast Media; Coronary; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary Artery Bypass; Data; Databases; design; Detection; Development; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Discipline; Dissection; Echocardiography; Engineering; Evaluation; Exhibits; follow-up; Functional disorder; Gadolinium; Goals; Gold; Heart; Heart Diseases; heart imaging; Image; Image Analysis; image reconstruction; imaging approach; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Individual; Infarction; Injections; Injury; Ionizing radiation; Knowledge; Lead; Magnetic Resonance; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Medicine; Mentors; Methods; Modality; Motion; MRI Scans; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial tissue; Myocardium; new technology; non-invasive imaging; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Oxygen; Patient imaging; patient oriented; patient oriented research; Patients; percutaneous coronary intervention; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Physiologic pulse; pre-clinical; Protocols documentation; Publishing; Reference Standards; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Roentgen Rays; Scanning; screening; Stents; Stroke; technique development; Techniques; technology research and development; Testing; Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test; Time; Tissues; Training; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Update; Validation; Ventricular Function; Work; ","MR Quantification of Myocardial Oxygen Utilization in Chronic Myocardial Infarction without Contrast","141634","MPOR","NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Review Committee ","","","03","153834","12307","166141",""

Because the bacterial ribosome is the molecular target of over half of the small-molecule antibiotics that are in current clinical use, the results of the proposed studies are expected to identify new targets and strategies for the development of next-generation antibiotics. Similarly, because aberrant control over the process through which the human ribosome synthesizes proteins plays a causal role in several human diseases, including numerous viral infections and cancers, the results of the proposed studies are expected to inform the development of small-molecule therapeutics that can be used to treat viral infections, cancers, and other human diseases.","1971251; ","GONZALEZ, RUBEN L;","REDDY, MICHAEL K","05/01/2020","02/29/2024","Address; Amino Acids; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacterial Model; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; Clinical; Codon Nucleotides; Collaborations; Complement; Cryoelectron Microscopy; cryogenics; Data; Development; Disease; Electron Microscopy; Eukaryota; Event; experimental study; flexibility; Fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; fluorophore; Frameshift Mutation; Gene Expression; Genome; Goals; Health; Human; human disease; In Vitro; Investigation; Kinetics; Label; Laboratories; Letters; Life; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Modeling; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Target; Motivation; next generation; Nucleotides; Organism; Play; polypeptide; Positioning Attribute; Process; Production; Property; Protein Biosynthesis; Proteins; public health relevance; reconstitution; Reporting; Resolution; Rest; Ribosomal Frameshifting; Ribosomal Proteins; Ribosomes; Role; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Series; Signal Transduction; single molecule; single-molecule FRET; small molecule; small molecule therapeutics; Specific qualifier value; Structure; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; Transfer RNA; Translations; Viral Cancer; Virus Diseases; Work; Yeasts; ","The structural dynamics of ribosomal frameshifting and ribosome rescue","137608","MGA","Molecular Genetics A Study Section ","","","02","266772","128834","395606",""

Mis-regulation of unstructured proteins has been additionally been implicated in cellular disease states, such as neural degeneration. Here we propose to study in detail cellular mechanisms involved in the inheritance and segregation of fluid phase-like germ cell determinants, leading to germ cell specification.

The proposal is innovative as it applies mixed methods, uses technology to capture event-level substance use and other risky behavioral data, and applies theory and methods that are couples-based.

To address this grand challenge, the objective of the proposed studies is to create a robust, integrated pipeline for rapid development of chemical probes and selective, high-affinity antibodies that are custom tailored for super-resolution imaging using expansion microscopy, thereby enabling ultrastructural investigation of the spatial expression of glycans and glycan-polypeptide determinants in cells and tissues. ! ! !","10309543; 7976402 (contact); 11404379; ","ALABI, CHRISTOPHER AKINLEYE; DELISA, MATTHEW P (contact); PASZEK, MATTHEW J;","BOND, MICHELLE RUEFFER","04/01/2020","02/29/2024","Address; Affinity; Alkynes; Anabolism; Antibodies; Antibody Affinity; Anticoagulation; Attenuated; Azides; Bacteria; base; Behavior; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biological Process; Cancer cell line; Carbohydrates; Catalogs; cell behavior; Cell Communication; cell growth; Cell surface; Cells; chemical group; chemical synthesis; Chemicals; Chemistry; Code; Communities; Complex; cost; Coupling; Custom; density; design; Detection; Development; Directed Molecular Evolution; Disease; Engineering; Ensure; Epitopes; established cell line; Etiology; Evolution; experimental study; Fluorescence; fluorescence microscope; Fluorescent Dyes; Fluorescent Probes; Galactose Binding Lectin; Gel; Generations; Glycobiology; Glycocalyx; Glycoconjugates; Growth; Growth and Development function; Health; Human; human disease; Image; Imaging Device; Imaging Techniques; Imaging technology; Immune; Immunofluorescence Immunologic; Immunoglobulin Fragments; immunoregulation; Individual; Investigation; Label; Length; Libraries; Life; Light; light microscopy; Lipids; Malignant Neoplasms; Manuals; Maps; Mediation; Metabolic; metabolic imaging; Methods; Microarray Analysis; microbial; Microscope; Microscopy; Molecular; Molecular Structure; Monosaccharides; nanometer; nanometer resolution; nanoscale; Noise; Normal Cell; novel strategies; optical imaging; Optics; Organism; organizational structure; Pathogenesis; Physiology; Play; polypeptide; Polysaccharides; Process; Protein Engineering; protein structure function; Proteins; protocol development; Protocols documentation; Reaction; Reagent; Receptor Signaling; Reporter; Research; Resolution; response; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Structure; sugar; Surface; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Swelling; System; Technology; Tissues; tool; user-friendly; Validation; Yeasts; ","Molecular toolkit for high content resolution of glycomes by expansionmicroscopy","137314","EBIT","Enabling Bioanalytical and Imaging Technologies Study Section ","","","02","244106","156228","400334",""

Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects a much smaller number of patients (30,000), but their risk of severe infection is greater and long-term prognosis is much poorer than patients with COPD or CRS. Each of these disorders has been linked to abnormally low levels of nitric oxide (NO), a potent endogenous antimicrobial/antiviral agent, within the airways of those afflicted with these diseases. Through the research described in this application, we will develop a very inexpensive and simple photochemical gas phase NO generating system for potential use at home by COPD, CRS and CF patients.","1867172; ","SCHWENDEMAN, STEVEN P.;","LASH, TIFFANI BAILEY","06/15/2020","02/28/2024","Adhesives; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Affect; Air; airway epithelium; Animal Testing; Animals; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antiviral Agents; Apical; Bacteria; base; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood capillaries; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell surface; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; chronic rhinosinusitis; Clinical; controlled release; cost; crystallinity; Cystic Fibrosis; cystic fibrosis airway epithelia; cystic fibrosis patients; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; cytotoxic; Devices; Disease; Dose; Electron Microscopy; Epithelial Cells; Exposure to; Failure; Feedback; Film; Free Radicals; Frequencies; Funding; Gases; Generations; Grant; high risk; Histology; Home environment; Hospitals; Human; IL8 gene; in vitro testing; in-home care; Individual; Infection; infection risk; Inflammatory; inhaled nitric oxide; Intensive Care; Ischemic Brain Injury; Knockout Mice; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Light; light intensity; light microscopy; Lighting; Link; Lung; Lung infections; Lung Transplantation; Malaria; Medical; Medicine; Membrane; Methemoglobin; Methods; Microbial Biofilms; Modeling; Monitor; Morphology; Mus; Mutation; natural antimicrobial; Neonatology; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; novel strategies; Orphan Drugs; Outcome; outcome forecast; Output; particle; Particle Size; Patients; Performance; Phase; Pneumonia; Polymers; Population; portability; pressure; prevent; Property; prototype; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; Pulmonary Hypertension; Pulmonary Tuberculosis; Reaction; Regimen; Research; Residual state; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk; S Phase; S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine; S-Nitrosothiols; scale up; sensor; Signal Transduction; Sinus; Sinusitis; Solid; solid state; Sputum; Stream; Stroke; Surface; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Uses; Tobramycin; Toxic effect; Vasodilator Agents; X ray diffraction analysis; ","Controlled Photochemical Release of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications","028775","ISD","Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ","","","02","308524","140744","449268",""

Malaria is also an ever-present threat to travelers visiting malaria-endemic regions. Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine is a new and highly effective tool with the potential to eliminate Plasmodium falciparum malaria from human populations in defined geographical areas and to protect travelers. The process of manufacturing the vaccine requires large numbers of mosquitoes. The goal of this proposal is to develop the low temperature, cryogenic storage of mosquitoes to increase the efficiency and robustness of vaccine manufacture and compliance with Phase 3 GMPs. At the same time, the work will benefit researchers working on anopheline molecular genetics, especially those aiming to suppress mosquito populations by mass release of genetically modified mosquitoes to break the cycle of malaria transmission.","8969338; ","BILLINGSLEY, PETER F.;","COSTERO-SAINT DENIS, ADRIANA","08/01/2010","01/31/2023","Adult; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Anopheles Genus; arm; Attenuated; attenuation; base; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood; Breeding; Burkina Faso; Businesses; Certification; Child; Clinical Trials; cold temperature; Communities; Conduct Clinical Trials; cryogenics; Cryopreservation; Culicidae; Cyclic GMP; Data; Development; Dose; drug candidate; egg; Embryo; Ensure; Equatorial Guinea; Equipment Failure; Event; Exposure to; Falciparum Malaria; Female; Funding; Future; Gabon; gamma irradiation; Generations; Genetic Drift; Geographic Locations; Germany; Goals; Harvest; Human; Infection; Laboratories; Laboratory Research; Larva; Licensing; Life Cycle Stages; Malaria; malaria infection; malaria transmission; Malaria Vaccines; Mali; manufacturing process; Metabolic; Methodology; Methods; Molecular Genetics; Mosquito Control; Natural Immunity; Natural Resistance; novel; oocyte cryopreservation; Parasitic Diseases; Partner in relationship; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; Phenotype; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium falciparum vaccine; Population; Preparation; Process; Production; programs; public health relevance; Publications; Quality Control; Radiation; Readiness; Regimen; Research; research clinical testing; Research Personnel; Resources; Resuscitation; Salivary Glands; scale up; Services; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Source; Sporozoites; success; Tanzania; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; vaccine candidate; vaccine efficacy; Vaccines; Vial device; Visit; Work; zygote; ","Cryopreservation of Anopheles Embryos","088853","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","","","962110",""

We will then integrate these results with a wide range of emerging information about gene regulation and expression in specific cells and tissues in the brain across human development, as well as brain imaging information, that together can help to identify when and where in the brain the TS risk genes work together to cause disease, define the tissues and/or cell types in which to conduct future studies of disease mechanisms, and potentially point to targets for new treatments.","1884731; 14386255; 8567617 (contact); ","MATHEWS, CAROL A; PASCHOU, PERISTERA ; SCHARF, JEREMIAH M (contact);","MORRIS, JILL A","04/01/2019","01/31/2024","Affect; Animal Model; Area; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; biobank; biological sex; Biology; boys; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain region; brain volume; Cell model; cell type; Cells; Child; Clinical; cohort; Collaborations; comorbidity; Complex; Complex Genetic Trait; Computerized Medical Record; Copy Number Polymorphism; Data; data registry; Data Set; Development; Disease; disease mechanisms study; Disease model; DNA; Electronic Health Record; Epigenetic Process; epigenomics; Etiology; European; Family; Female; functional disability; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; gene discovery; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic; genetic architecture; Genetic Research; Genetic Risk; Genetic study; genetic variant; genome wide association study; genome-wide; genome-wide analysis; genomic data; Genomics; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; girls; Goals; Health; Heritability; Human Development; imaging genetics; improved; Individual; innovation; Lead; Maintenance; male; Molecular; Motor Tics; multiple datasets; neurodevelopment; neurogenomics; neuroimaging; neuropsychiatric disorder; Neurosciences; novel therapeutics; Obsessive compulsive behavior; Pathogenesis; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; polygenic risk score; Predisposition; Prevalence; Publications; Quality of life; Recording of previous events; Registries; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; risk variant; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; sex; Sex Differences; spatiotemporal; Stigmatization; Structure; Subgroup; Susceptibility Gene; Testing; Time; Tissues; transcriptomics; United States National Institutes of Health; Vocal Tics; Work; ","Large-scale collaborative genetic and epigenetic studies of Tourette Syndrome","105746","GHD","Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section ","","","03","550999","97188","648187",""
